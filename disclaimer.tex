\section*{Disclaimer}

I hereby declare that, except where acknowledged appropriately either below or in the text, this thesis is my original work undertaken at the Australian National University between February 2012 and August 2015. It has not been submitted for a higher degree at any other university or institution.

This thesis has been submitted as a `Thesis by Compilation' in accordance with the relevant ANU policies. Each of the three main chapters (\ref{chap:shingleskarakas2013}, \ref{chap:shinglesetal2014}, and \ref{chap:shinglesetal2015}) is therefore a completely self-contained article that has been published in a peer-reviewed journal.

Chapter \ref{chap:shingleskarakas2013} has been published in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society as \citet*{Shingles:2013kg}. This article includes some results that were previously included in the candidate's Honours thesis in 2011. In 2012, the candidate calculated new nucleosynthesis models to study the impact of the \iso{13}{C} and \iso{22}{Ne} neutron sources and developed the text and figures for publication. Amanda Karakas guided the scientific content of the paper and contributed some sections of text in the Discussion and Conclusions section.

Chapter \ref{chap:shinglesetal2014} has been published in Astrophysical Journal as \citet*{Shingles:2014ja}. The main scientific insights, analysis, figures, and the manuscript were the produced by the candidate with minor revisions in response to feedback from coauthors and the referee. The chemical evolution code used in this project was developed solely by the candidate. The chemical evolution model incorporated tables of yields for massive stars provided by Raphael Hirschi and yields for AGB stars provided by Cherie Fishlock. Machine-readable abundance measurements for M4 and M5 were provided by David Yong.

Chapter \ref{chap:shinglesetal2015} has been published in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society as \citet*{Shingles:2015cd}. All evolution and nucleosynthesis models were calculated by the candidate except for the 6 \Msun, $Y=0.40$ nucleosynthesis model, which was calculated by Carolyn Doherty. The figures and all sections of the text were drafted by the candidate and revised with suggestions from coauthors and the referee.

The remainder of this thesis was drafted solely by the candidate and revised in response to comments by Amanda Karakas.
