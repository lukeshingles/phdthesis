abstract = {We review recent theoretical results on the formation of the first stars in the universe, and emphasize related open questions. In particular, we discuss the initial conditions for Population III star formation, as given by variants of the cold dark matter cosmology. Numerical simulations have investigated the collapse and the fragmentation of metal-free gas, showing that the first stars were predominantly very massive. The exact determination of the stellar masses, and the precise form of the primordial initial mass function, is still hampered by our limited understanding of the accretion physics and the protostellar feedback effects. We address the importance of heavy elements in bringing about the transition from an early star formation mode dominated by massive stars to the familiar mode dominated by low-mass stars at later times. We show how complementary observations, both at high redshifts and in our local cosmic neighborhood, can be utilized to probe the first epoch of star formation.},

abstract = {We present detailed evolutionary calculations focused on the evolution of intermediate mass stars with 3 M⊙ $\le$ M $\le$ 9 M⊙ of metallicity typical of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), i.e. Z=0.008. We carefully compare the models calculated by adopting a diffusive scheme for chemical mixing, in which nuclear burning and mixing are self-consistently coupled, while the eddy velocities beyond the formal convective core boundary are treated to decay exponentially, and those calculated with the traditional instantaneous mixing approximation. We find that: i) the physical and chemical behaviour of the models during the H-burning phase is independent of the scheme used for the treatment of mixing inside the CNO burning core; ii) the duration of the He-burning phase relative to the MS phase is systematically longer in the diffusive models, due to a slower redistribution of helium to the core from the outer layers; iii) the fraction of time spent in the blue part of the clump, compared to the stay in the red, is larger in the diffusive models. The differences described in points ii) and iii) tend to vanish for M > 6 M⊙. In terms of the theoretical interpretation of an open cluster stellar population, the differences introduced by the use of a self-consistent scheme for mixing in the core with adjacent exponential decay are relevant for ages in the range 80 Myr < t < 200 Myr. These results are robust, since they are insensitive to the choice of the free-parameters regulating the extension of the extra-mixing region.},

abstract = {Available data on the metal abundances of globular clusters are combined to examine the question of the existence of a metallicity gradient in the halo of the Milky Way. The average metallicity defined by the globular clusters declines slowly with galactocentric distance, following an exponential law, out to at least 100 kpc from the galactic center. At all galactocentric distances, the scatter in cluster metal abundances is large, {\textpm}0.3 in [Fe/H]. Although the gradient is weak, its existence implies that the clusters did participate in a general, homologous collapse of the Milky Way and did not form separately.},

abstract = {Models of galactic chemical evolution study how the chemical elements have formed and dispersed in the Universe. During the Big Bang, only light elements, such as hydrogen (H), deuterium (D), helium (He), and a very tiny fraction of lithium (7Li) were formed, while all the other elements from carbon to uranium and beyond were formed inside the stars. The chemical elements and their isotopes are characterized by their mass number (A), namely, the sum of the protons and neutrons composing their nuclei. So, when we write 7Li, it means that A= 7 for Li. Elements with A = 5 and A = 8 do not exist because they would not be stable, elements with A = 9, 10, 11 are the isotopes of berillium (Be) and boron (B), which are formed, together with 6Li and some 7Li during spallation processes, which derive from the interaction between cosmic rays and interstellar atoms of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and oxygen (O). All the elements with A $\ge$ 12 starting from 12C have been synthesized inside the stars and the sum of all of them in Astronomy is called metallicity and indicated with capital Z.},

The separation of those parts of the network where only neutron-capture and beta-decay reactions are significant provides a substantial advantage in computational efficiency. We present the yields for a complete set of s-process isotopes for a 3-Msolar, Z = 0.02 stellar model, as a demonstration of the utility of the approach. Future work will include a large grid of models suitable for use in calculations of Galactic chemical evolution.},

abstract = {We show that the inclusion of special relativistic corrections in the revised OPAL and MHD equations of state has a significant impact on the helioseismic determination of the solar age. Models with relativistic corrections included lead to a reduction of about 0.05-0.08 ; Gyr with respect to those obtained with the old OPAL or MHD EOS. Our best-fit value is tseis = (4.57 +/- 0.11) ; Gyr which is in remarkably good agreement with the meteoritic value for the solar age. We argue that the inclusion of relativistic corrections is important for probing the evolutionary state of a star by means of the small frequency separations delta nu l,n=nu l,n-nu l+2,n-1, for spherical harmonic degrees l = 0,1 and radial order n >> l.},

abstract = {The p-process of stellar nucleosynthesis is aimed at explaining the production of the stable neutron-deficient nuclides heavier than iron that are observed up to now in the solar system exclusively. Various scenarios have been proposed to account for the bulk p-nuclide content of the solar system, as well as for deviations (`anomalies') with respect to the bulk p-isotope composition of some elements discovered in primitive meteorites. The astrophysics of these models is reviewed, and the involved nuclear physics is discussed, including a brief account of recent experimental efforts. Already published results are complemented with new ones. A specific attention is paid to the very rare odd-odd nuclides 138La and 180Tam, as well as to the puzzling case of the light Mo and Ru isotopes. Astrophysics and nuclear physics prospects of improvements in the p-process modeling are presented.},

In particular, the response of the model to periodic driving at its inner boundary was examined for a considerable range of stellar parameters for both fundamental and overtone modes, various driving amplitudes, and various assumptions about the physical processes involved; radiation pressure on dust and time-dependent temperature relaxation were included. Stable steady state models with periodic shocks were obtained in all cases. Both shocks and dust were found to be essential for rapid mass loss. The shocks increase the density and thus greatly increase the amount of dust formed in the cool outer atmosphere. Radiation pressure accelerates the grains, which drive a slow cool wind. Calculated mass-loss rates appear to be of the right order of magnitude to agree with observations and show how mass loss can be expected to depend on the stellar parameters.},

abstract = {In a previous paper we compared the spectral energy distributions of a sample of 808 K+A galaxies from the far ultraviolet to the mid infrared to the predictions of the spectrum synthesis models explicitly using asymptotic giant branch components. Here we use the new AGB-light models from C. Maraston (including less fuel for the later stages of stellar evolution and improved calibrations) to address the discrepancies between our observations and the AGB-heavy models used in our previous paper, which over-predict the infrared fluxes of post-starburst galaxies by an order of magnitude. The new models yield a much better fit to the data, especially in the near-IR, compared to previous realisations where AGB stars caused a large excess in the H and K bands. We also compare the predictions of the M2013 models to those with BC03 and find that both reproduce the observations equally well.We still find a significant discrepancy with both sets of models in the Y and J bands, which however is probably due to the spectral features of AGB stars. We also find that both the M2013 and the BC03 models still over-predict the observed fluxes in the UV bands, even invoking extinction laws that are stronger in these bands. While there may be some simple explanations for this discrepancy, we find that further progress requires new observations and better modelling. Excess mid-infrared emission longwards of 5 $\mu$m is well modelled by a Tdust = 300 K black body, which may arise from dust emission from the circumstellar envelopes of oxygen rich M stars (expected for a metal-rich population of AGB stars).},

abstract = {Aims: The nitrogen-to-carbon (N/C) and nitrogen-to-oxygen (N/O) ratios are the most sensitive quantities to mixing in stellar interiors of intermediate and massive stars. We further investigate the theoretical properties of these ratios as well as put in context recent observational results obtained by the VLT-FLAMES Survey of massive stars in the Galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds. Methods: We consider analytical relations and numerical models of stellar evolution as well as our own stellar atmosphere models, and we critically re-investigate observed spectra. Results: On the theoretical side, the N/C vs. N/O plot shows little dependence on the initial stellar masses, rotation velocities, and nature of the mixing processes up to relative enrichment of N/O by a factor of about four, thus this plot constitutes an ideal quality test for observational results. The comparison between the FLAMES Survey and theoretical values shows overall agreement, despite the observational scatter of the published results. The existence of some mixing of CNO products is clearly confirmed, however the accuracy of the data is not sufficient for allowing a test of the significant differences between different models of rotating stars and the Geneva models. We discuss reasons (for the most part due to observational bias) why part of the observational data points should not be considered for this comparison. When these observational data points are not considered, the scatter is reduced. Finally, the N/C vs. N/O plot potentially offers a powerful way for discriminating blue supergiants before the red supergiant stage from those after it. Also, red supergiants of similar low velocities may exhibit different N enrichments, depending on their initial rotation during the main-sequence phase.

abstract = {Context. Models have been made of stars of a given mass that produce planetary nebulae that usually begin on the AGB (although they may begin earlier) and run to the white dwarf stage. While these models cover the so-called dredge-up phases when nuclear reactions occur and the newly formed products are brought to the surface, it is important to compare the abundances predicted by the models with the abundances actually observed in PNe. Aims: The aim of the paper is to determine the abundances in a group of PNe with uniform morphological and kinematic properties. The PNe we discuss are circular with rather low-temperature central stars and are rather far from the galactic plane. We discuss the effect these abundances have on determining the evolution of the central stars of these PNe. Methods: The mid-infrared spectra of the planetary nebulae NGC 1535, NGC 6629, He2-108, and Tc1 (IC 1266) taken with the Spitzer Space Telescope are presented. These spectra were combined with the ultraviolet IUE spectra and with the spectra in the visual wavelength region to obtain complete, extinction-corrected spectra. The chemical composition of these nebulae is then found by directly calculating and adding individual ion abundances. For two of these PNe, we attempted to reproduce the observed spectrum by making a model nebula. This proved impossible for one of the nebulae and the reason for this is discussed. The resulting abundances are more accurate than earlier studies for several reasons, the most important is that inclusion of the far infrared spectra increases the number of observed ions and makes it possible to include the nebular temperature gradient in the abundance calculations. Results: The abundances of the above four PNe have been determined and compared to the abundances found in five other PNe with similar properties studied earlier. These abundances are further compared with values predicted by the models of Karakas (2003). From this comparison we conclude that the central stars of these PNe originally had a low mass, probably between 1 M{\&}sun; and 2.5 M{\&}sun;. A further comparison is made with the stellar evolution models on the HR diagram, from which we conclude that the core mass of these PNe is between 0.56 M{\&}sun; and 0.63 M{\&}sun;. Conclusions: A consistent picture of the evolution of this group of PNe is found that agrees with the predictions of the models concerning the present nebular abundances, the individual masses, and luminosities of these PNe. The distance of these PNe can be determined as well. Based on observations with the Spitzer Space Telescope, which is operated by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology.},

abstract = {We present mid-infrared Spitzer spectra of 11 planetary nebulae in the Galactic bulge. We derive argon, neon, sulfur, and oxygen abundances for them using mainly infrared line fluxes combined with some optical line fluxes from the literature. Due to the high extinction toward the bulge, the infrared spectra allow us to determine abundances for certain elements more accurately than previously possible with optical data alone. Abundances of argon and sulfur (and in most cases neon and oxygen) in planetary nebulae in the bulge give the abundances of the interstellar medium at the time their progenitor stars formed; thus, these abundances give information about the formation and evolution of the bulge. The abundances of bulge planetary nebulae tend to be slightly higher than those in the disk on average, but they do not follow the trend of the disk planetary nebulae, thus confirming the difference between bulge and disk evolution. In addition, the bulge planetary nebulae show peculiar dust properties compared to the disk nebulae. Oxygen-rich dust features (crystalline silicates) dominate the spectra of all of the bulge planetary nebulae; such features are more scarce in disk nebulae. In addition, carbon-rich dust features (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) appear in roughly half of the bulge planetary nebulae in our sample, which is interesting in light of the fact that this dual chemistry is comparatively rare in the Milky Way as a whole.},

Spectra taken in May and October 1996 indicate a decrease in the surface hydrogen abundance by 0.7dex in five months along with an increase in the abundances of Li, Sr, Y and Zr. The abundance changes are in agreement with the hypothesis of the star being a rapidly evolving "born-again" AGB star experiencing a final He-shell flash, similar to FGSge. The ^12^C/^13^C ratio in October is very low, also suggesting hydrogen ingestion. By chemical composition, Sakurai's object resembles the R Coronae Borealis (RCrB) stars.},

abstract = {The horizontal branch (HB) morphology of globular clusters (GCs) is mainly governed by metallicity. The second parameter problem, well known since the 1960s, states that metallicity alone is not enough to describe the observed HB morphology of many GCs. Despite many efforts to resolve this issue, the second parameter phenomenon still remains without a satisfactory explanation. We have analyzed blue-HB, red-HB, and RR-Lyrae stars in the GC M4 and studied their Fe, Na, and O abundances. Our goal is to investigate possible connections between the bimodal HB of M4 and the chemical signatures of the two stellar populations recently discovered among red giants of this cluster. We obtained FLAMES-UVES/GIRAFFE spectra of a sample of 22 stars covering the HB from the red to the blue region. While iron has the same abundance in both the red-HB and blue-HB segments, the red-HB is composed of stars with scaled-solar sodium abundances, while the blue-HB stars are all sodium enhanced and oxygen depleted. The RR-Lyrae are Na-poor, as the red-HB stars, and O-rich. This is what we expect if the blue-HB consists of a second generation of stars formed from the ejecta produced by an earlier stellar population through high-temperature hydrogen-burning processes that include the CNO, NeNa, and MgAl cycles and are therefore expected to be He-rich. According to this scenario, the sodium and oxygen pattern detected in the blue-HB and red-HB segments suggests helium as the second parameter that rules the HB morphology in M4.

abstract = {The determination of the Ba abundance in globular cluster (GC) stars is a very powerful test to address several issues in the framework of multiple population scenarios. We measured the Ba content for a sample of more than 1200 stars in 15 Galactic GCs, using high-resolution FLAMES/Giraffe spectra. We found no variation in [Ba/Fe] ratios for different stellar populations within each cluster; this means that low-mass asymptotic giant branch stars do not significantly contribute to the intracluster pollution. Very interestingly, we found that the fraction of Ba stars in first generation (FG) stars is close to the values derived for field stars ({\textasciitilde}2%); on the other hand, second generation (SG) stars present a significantly lower fraction. An independent and successful test, based on radial velocity variations among giant stars in NGC 6121, confirms our finding: the binary fraction among FG stars is about {\textasciitilde}12%, to be compared with {\textasciitilde}1% of SG stars. This is an evidence that SG stars formed in a denser environment, where infant mortality of binary systems was particularly efficient. Based on observations collected at ESO under programs 072.D-507 and 073.D-0211.},

abstract = {We calculate a grid of star models with and without the effects of axial rotation for stars in the mass range between 2 and 60 Msun for the metallicity Z = 10-5. Star models with initial masses superior or equal to 9 Msun were computed up to the end of the carbon-burning phase. Star models with masses between 2 and 7 Msun were evolved beyond the end of the He-burning phase through a few thermal pulses during the AGB phase. Compared to models at Z=0.02, the low Z models show faster rotating cores and stronger internal Omega -gradients, which favour an important mixing of the chemical elements. The enhancement of N/C at the surface may reach 2 to 3 orders of magnitude for fast rotating stars. Surface enrichments may make the evolved stars less metal poor than they were initially. In very low Z models, primary nitrogen is produced during the He-burning phase by rotational diffusion of 12C into the H-burning shell. A large fraction of the primary 14N escapes further destruction and enters the envelope of AGB stars, being ejected during the TP-AGB phase and the formation of a planetary nebula. The intermediate mass stars of very low Z are the main producers of primary 14N, but massive stars also contribute to this production; no significant primary nitrogen is made in models at metallicity Z=0.004 or above. We calculate the chemical yields in He, C, N, O and heavy elements and discuss the chemical evolution of the CNO elements at very low Z. Remarkably, the C/O vs. O/H diagram is mainly sensitive to the interval of stellar masses, while the N/O vs. O/H diagram is mainly sensitive to the average rotation of the stars contributing to the element synthesis. The presently available observations in these diagrams seem to favour contributions either from stars down to about 2 Msun with normal rotation velocities or from stars above 8 Msun but with very fast rotation.},

abstract = {Aims.In this paper we study the effects of rotation in low-mass, low-metallicity RGB stars. Methods: .We present the first evolutionary models taking into account self-consistently the latest prescriptions for the transport of angular momentum by meridional circulation and shear turbulence in stellar interiors as well as the associated mixing processes for chemicals computed from the ZAMS to the upper RGB. We discuss the uncertainties associated with the physical description of the rotational mixing in detail and carefully study their effects on the rotation profile, diffusion coefficients, structural evolution, lifetimes, and chemical signatures at the stellar surface. We focus in particular on the various assumptions concerning the rotation law in the convective envelope, the initial rotation velocity distribution, the presence of $\mu$-gradients, and the treatment of the horizontal and vertical turbulence. Results: .This exploration leads to two main conclusions. (1) After completion of the first dredge-up, the degree of differential rotation (and hence mixing) is maximised in the case of a differentially rotating convective envelope (i.e., jCE(r) = const.), as anticipated in previous studies. (2) Even with this assumption, and contrary to some previous claims, the present treatment for the evolution of the rotation profile and associated meridional circulation and shear turbulence does not lead to enough mixing of chemicals to explain the abundance anomalies in low-metallicity field and globular cluster RGB stars observed around the bump luminosity. Conclusions: .This study raises questions that need to be addressed in the near future. These include, for example, the interaction between rotation and convection and the trigger of additional hydrodynamical instabilities.},

abstract = {Context. Carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars are known to have properties that reflect the nucleosynthesis of the first low- and intermediate-mass stars, because most have been polluted by a now-extinct AGB star. Aims: By considering abundances in the various CEMP subclasses separately, we try to derive parameters (such as metallicity, mass, temperature, and neutron source) characterising AGB nucleosynthesis from the specific signatures imprinted on the abundances, and separate them from the impact of thermohaline mixing, first dredge-up, and dilution associated with the mass transfer from the companion. Methods: To place CEMP stars in a broader context, we collect abundances for about 180 stars of various metallicities (from solar to [Fe/H] =-4), luminosity classes (dwarfs and giants), and abundance patterns (e.g. C-rich and poor, Ba-rich and poor), from both our own sample and the literature. Results: We first show that there are CEMP stars that share the properties of CEMP-s stars and CEMP-no stars (which we refer to as CEMP-low-s stars). We also show that there is a strong correlation between Ba and C abundances in the s-only CEMP stars. This represents a strong detection of the operation of the 13C neutron source in low-mass AGB stars. For the CEMP-rs stars (seemingly enriched with elements from both the s- and r-processes), the correlation of the N abundances with abundances of heavy elements from the 2nd and 3rd s-process peaks bears instead the signature of the 22Ne neutron source. Since CEMP-rs stars also exhibit O and Mg enhancements, we conclude that extremely hot conditions prevailed during the thermal pulses of the contaminating AGB stars. We also note that abundances are not affected by the evolution of the CEMP-rs star itself (especially by the first dredge-up). This implies that mixing must have occurred while the star was on the main sequence, and that a large amount of matter must have been accreted so as to trigger thermohaline mixing. Finally, we argue that most CEMP-no stars (with neutron-capture element abundances comparable to non-CEMP stars) are likely the extremely metal-poor counterparts of CEMP neutron-capture-rich stars. We also show that the C enhancement in CEMP-no stars declines with metallicity at extremely low metallicity ([Fe/H] < -3.2). This trend is not predicted by any of the current AGB models.

abstract = {The first stars that formed after the Big Bang were probably massive, and they provided the Universe with the first elements heavier than helium (`metals'), which were incorporated into low-mass stars that have survived to the present. Eight stars in the oldest globular cluster in the Galaxy, NGC6522, were found to have surface abundances consistent with the gas from which they formed being enriched by massive stars (that is, with higher $\alpha$-element/Fe and Eu/Fe ratios than those of the Sun). However, the same stars have anomalously high abundances of Ba and La with respect to Fe, which usually arises through nucleosynthesis in low-mass stars (via the slow-neutron-capture process, or s-process). Recent theory suggests that metal-poor fast-rotating massive stars are able to boost the s-process yields by up to four orders of magnitude, which might provide a solution to this contradiction. Here we report a reanalysis of the earlier spectra, which reveals that Y and Sr are also overabundant with respect to Fe, showing a large scatter similar to that observed in extremely metal-poor stars, whereas C abundances are not enhanced. This pattern is best explained as originating in metal-poor fast-rotating massive stars, which might point to a common property of the first stellar generations and even of the `first stars'.},

abstract = {We present the first high-resolution spectroscopic study on the Orphan stream for five stream candidates, observed with the Magellan Inamori Kyocera Echelle spectrograph on the Magellan Clay telescope. The targets were selected from the low-resolution catalog of Casey et al.: three high-probability members, one medium, and one low-probability stream candidate were observed. Our analysis indicates that the low- and medium-probability targets are metal-rich field stars. The remaining three high-probability targets range over {\textasciitilde}1 dex in metallicity, and are chemically distinct compared to the other two targets and all standard stars: low [$\alpha$/Fe] abundance ratios are observed, and lower limits are ascertained for [Ba/Y], which sit well above the Milky Way trend. These chemical signatures demonstrate that the undiscovered parent system is unequivocally a dwarf spheroidal galaxy, consistent with dynamical constraints inferred from the stream width and arc. As such, we firmly exclude the proposed association between NGC 2419 and the Orphan stream. A wide range in metallicities adds to the similarities between the Orphan stream and Segue 1, although the low [$\alpha$/Fe] abundance ratios in the Orphan stream are in tension with the high [$\alpha$/Fe] values observed in Segue 1. Open questions remain before Segue 1 could possibly be claimed as the "parent" of the Orphan stream. The parent system could well remain undiscovered in the southern sky. This paper includes data gathered with the 6.5 m Magellan Telescopes located at Las Campanas Observatory, Chile.},

A correlation between the electron temperature and the ionization potential is found. Ionic abundances for the observed infrared ions have been derived, and the total neon and sulfur abundances have been determined.

abstract = {Data from several large elliptical and disk galaxies now show that globular clusters more massive than approximately 105 solar mass follow a power-law number distribution by mass, N approximately M-1.7, which is virtually independent of environment. Within observational uncertainty, this relation is identical to the shape of the mass distributions of giant molecular clouds (GMCs) in large spiral galaxies, the cloud cores embedded in GMCs, and giant H II regions in large spiral galaxies. We interpret this within a model whereby globular clusters formed out of dense cores within supergiant molecular clouds (SGMCs) that were present in the early protogalactic epoch. We construct a theory of pressure confined, self-gravitating, isothermal, magnetized molecular clouds and cores, based on the viral theorem and the observed mass spectra, and derive the characteristic physical properties of these parent SGMCs. These turn out to be of the right mass and density range to resemble the Searle-Zinn primordial fragments from which larger galaxies may have assembled. We suggest that the protocluster clouds were supported against gravitational collapse primarily by a combination of magnetic field pressure and Alfvenic turbulence, as is observed to be the case for contemporary molecular clouds. This approach removes the need for arbitrary external heat sources (such as long-lasting AGNs or Population III stars) to keep the clouds stable for long enough times to build up to globular-sized masses and more easily permits the global properties of the emergent clusters to be similar from one galaxy to another. By calculating lifetimes through a standard cloud growth model, we estimate that the principal epoch of globular cluster formation should have begun no earlier than a redshift of z approximately equal to 6.},

abstract = {We present a new analysis of the long-period variables in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) from the MACHO Variable Star Catalog. Three-quarters of our sample of evolved, variable stars have periodic light curves. We characterize the stars in our sample using the multiple periods found in their frequency spectra. Additionally, we use single-epoch Two Micron All Sky Survey measurements to construct the average infrared light curves for different groups of these stars. Comparison with evolutionary models shows that stars on the red giant branch (RGB) or the early asymptotic giant branch (AGB) often show non-periodic variability, but begin to pulsate with periods on the two shortest period-luminosity (P-L) sequences (3 {\&} 4) when they brighten to K s $\approx$ 13. The stars on the thermally pulsing AGB are more likely to pulsate with longer periods that lie on the next two P-L sequences (1 {\&} 2), including the sequence associated with the Miras in the LMC. The Petersen diagram and its variants show that multi-periodic stars on each pair of these sequences (3 {\&} 4, and 1 {\&} 2) typically pulsate with periods associated only with that pair. The periods in these multi-periodic stars become longer and stronger as the star evolves. We further constrain the mechanism behind the long secondary periods (LSPs) seen in half of our sample, and find that there is a close match between the luminosity functions of the LSP stars and all of the stars in our sample, and that these star's pulsation amplitudes are relatively wavelength independent. Although this is characteristic of stellar multiplicity, the large number of these variables is problematic for that explanation.},

abstract = {We present nucleosynthesis calculations and the resulting 19F stellar yields for a large set of models with different masses and metallicity. During the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase, 19F is produced as a consequence of nucleosynthesis occurring during the convective thermal pulses and also during the interpulse periods if protons from the envelope are partially mixed in the top layers of the He intershell (partial mixing zone). We find that the production of fluorine depends on the temperature of the convective pulses, the amount of primary 12C mixed into the envelope by third dredge-up, and the extent of the partial mixing zone. Then we perform a detailed analysis of the reaction rates involved in the production of 19F and the effects of their uncertainties. We find that the major uncertainties are associated with the 14C($\alpha$, $\gamma$)18O and 19F($\alpha$, p)22Ne reaction rates. For these two reactions we present new estimates of the rates and their uncertainties. In both cases the revised rates are lower than previous estimates. The effect of the inclusion of the partial mixing zone on the production of fluorine strongly depends on the very uncertain 14C($\alpha$, $\gamma$)18O reaction rate. The importance of the partial mixing zone is reduced when using our estimate for this rate. Overall, rate uncertainties result in uncertainties in the fluorine production of about 50% in stellar models with mass {\textasciitilde}=3 Msolar and of about a factor of 7 in stellar models of mass {\textasciitilde}=5 Msolar. This larger effect at high masses is due to the high uncertainties of the 19F($\alpha$, p)22Ne reaction rate. Taking into account both the uncertainties related to the partial mixing zone and those related to nuclear reactions, the highest values of 19F enhancements observed in AGB stars are not matched by the models. This is a problem that will have to be revised by providing a better understanding of the formation and nucleosynthesis in the partial mixing zone, as well as in relation to reducing the uncertainties of the 14C($\alpha$, $\gamma$)18O reaction rate. At the same time, the possible effect of cool bottom processing at the base of the convective envelope should be included in the computation of AGB nucleosynthesis. This process could, in principle, help to match the highest 19F abundances observed by decreasing the C/O ratio at the surface of the star, while leaving the 19F abundance unchanged.},

abstract = {The Type Ia supernova SN 2011fe is one of the closest supernovae of the past decades. Due to its proximity and low dust extinction, this object provides a very rare opportunity to study the extremely late time evolution (>900 days) of thermonuclear supernovae. In this Letter, we present our photometric data of SN 2011fe taken at an unprecedented late epoch of $\approx$930 days with GMOS-N mounted on the Gemini North telescope (g = 23.43 {\textpm} 0.28, r = 24.14 {\textpm} 0.14, i = 23.91 {\textpm} 0.18, and z = 23.90 {\textpm} 0.17) to study the energy production and retention in the ejecta of SN 2011fe. Together with previous measurements by other groups, our result suggests that the optical supernova light curve can still be explained by the full thermalization of the decay positrons of 56Co. This is in spite of theoretical predicted effects (e.g., infrared catastrophe, positron escape, and dust) that advocate a substantial energy redistribution and/or loss via various processes that result in a more rapid dimming at these very late epochs.},

abstract = {A Monte Carlo code (ARTIS) for modelling time-dependent three-dimensional spectral synthesis in chemically inhomogeneous models of Type Ia supernova ejecta is presented. Following the propagation of $\gamma$-ray photons, emitted by the radioactive decay of the nucleosynthesis products, energy is deposited in the supernova ejecta and the radiative transfer problem is solved self-consistently, enforcing the constraint of energy conservation in the comoving frame. Assuming a photoionization-dominated plasma, the equations of ionization equilibrium are solved together with the thermal balance equation adopting an approximate treatment of excitation. Since we implement a fully general treatment of line formation, there are no free parameters to adjust. Thus, a direct comparison between synthetic spectra and light curves, calculated from hydrodynamic explosion models, and observations is feasible. The code is applied to the well-known W7 explosion model and the results tested against other studies. Finally, the effect of asymmetric ejecta on broad-band light curves and spectra is illustrated using an elliptical toy model.},

abstract = {Abundance anomalies observed in globular cluster stars indicate pollution with material processed by hydrogen burning. Two main sources have been suggested: asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars and massive stars rotating near the break-up limit (spin stars). We propose massive binaries as an alternative source of processed material. We compute the evolution of a 20 {M}⊙ star in a close binary considering the effects of non conservative mass and angular momentum transfer and of rotation and tidal interaction to demonstrate the principle. We find that this system sheds about 10 {M}⊙ of material, nearly the entire envelope of the primary star. The ejecta are enriched in He, N, Na, and Al and depleted in C and O, similar to the abundance patterns observed in gobular cluster stars. However, Mg is not significantly depleted in the ejecta of this model. In contrast to the fast, radiatively driven winds of massive stars, this material is typically ejected with low velocity. We expect that it remains inside the potential well of a globular cluster and becomes available for the formation or pollution of a second generation of stars. We estimate that the amount of processed low-velocity material ejected by massive binaries is greater than the contribution of AGB stars and spin stars combined, assuming that the majority of massive stars in a proto-globular cluster interact with a companion and return their envelope to the interstellar medium. If we take the possible contribution of intermediate mass stars in binaries into account and assume that the ejecta are diluted with an equal amount of unprocessed material, we find that this scenario can potentially provide enough material to form a second generation of low-mass stars, which is as numerous as the first generation of low-mass stars, without the need to make commonly adopted assumptions, such as preferential loss of the first generation of stars, external pollution of the cluster, or an anomalous initial mass function.},

abstract = {Proton-rich material in a state of nuclear statistical equilibrium (NSE) is one of the least studied regimes of nucleosynthesis. One reason for this is that after hydrogen burning, stellar evolution proceeds at conditions of an equal number of neutrons and protons or at a slight degree of neutron-richness. Proton-rich nucleosynthesis in stars tends to occur only when hydrogen-rich material that accretes onto a white dwarf or a neutron star explodes, or when neutrino interactions in the winds from a nascent proto-neutron star or collapsar disk drive the matter proton-rich prior to or during the nucleosynthesis. In this Letter we solve the NSE equations for a range of proton-rich thermodynamic conditions. We show that cold proton-rich NSE is qualitatively different from neutron-rich NSE. Instead of being dominated by the Fe-peak nuclei with the largest binding energy per nucleon that have a proton-to-nucleon ratio close to the prescribed electron fraction, NSE for proton-rich material near freezeout temperature is mainly composed of 56Ni and free protons. Previous results of nuclear reaction network calculations rely on this nonintuitive high-proton abundance, which this Letter explains. We show how the differences and especially the large fraction of free protons arises from the minimization of the free energy as a result of a delicate competition between the entropy and nuclear binding energy.},

abstract = {Over the past 20 years, stellar evolutionary models have been strongly improved in order to reproduce with reasonable accuracy both photometric and spectroscopic observations. Notwithstanding, the majority of these models do not take into account macroscopic phenomena, like rotation and/or magnetic fields. Their explicit treatment could modify stellar physical and chemical properties. One of the most interesting problems related to stellar nucleosynthesis is the behavior of the s-process spectroscopic indexes ([hs/ls] and [Pb/hs]) in Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars. In this contribution we show that, for a fixed metallicity, rotation can lead to a spread in the [hs/ls] and [Pb/hs] in low-mass AGB stars. In particular, we demonstrate that the Eddington-Sweet and the Goldreich-Schubert-Fricke instabilities may have enough time to smear the 13C-pocket (the major neutron source) and the 14N-pocket (the major neutron poison). In fact, a different overlap between these pockets leads to a different neutrons-to-seeds ratio, with important consequences on the corresponding s-process distributions. Possible consequences on the chemical evolution of Galactic globular clusters are discussed.},

abstract = {Omega Centauri is no longer the only globular cluster known to contain multiple stellar populations, yet it remains the most puzzling. Due to the extreme way in which the multiple stellar population phenomenon manifests in this cluster, it has been suggested that it may be the remnant of a larger stellar system. In this work, we present a spectroscopic investigation of the stellar populations hosted in the globular cluster $\omega$ Centauri to shed light on its still puzzling chemical enrichment history. With this aim, we used FLAMES+GIRAFFE@VLT to observe 300 stars distributed along the multimodal red giant branch of this cluster, sampling with good statistics the stellar populations of different metallicities. We determined chemical abundances for Fe, Na, O, and n-capture elements Ba and La. We confirm that $\omega$ Centauri exhibits large star-to-star variations in iron with [Fe/H] ranging from {\textasciitilde}-2.0 to {\textasciitilde}-0.7 dex. Barium and lanthanum abundances of metal-poor stars are correlated with iron, up to [Fe/H] {\textasciitilde}-1.5, while they are almost constant (or at least have only a moderate increase) in the more metal-rich populations. There is an extended Na-O anticorrelation for stars with [Fe/H] lsim-1.3 while more metal-rich stars are almost all Na-rich. Sodium was found to mildly increase with iron over the entire metallicity range. Based on data collected at the European Southern Observatory with the VLT-UT2, Paranal, Chile.},

abstract = {We present the first set of a new generation of models of massive stars with a solar composition extending between 13 and 120 M {\&}sun;, computed with and without the effects of rotation. We included two instabilities induced by rotation: the meridional circulation and the shear instability. We implemented two alternative schemes to treat the transport of the angular momentum: the advection-diffusion formalism and the simpler purely diffusive one. The full evolution from the pre-main sequence up to the pre-supernova stage is followed in detail with a very extended nuclear network. The explosive yields are provided for a variety of possible mass cuts and are available at the Web site http://www.iasf-roma.inaf.it/orfeo/public_html. We find that both the He and the CO core masses are larger than those of their non-rotating counterparts. Also the C abundance left by the He burning is lower than in the non-rotating case, especially for stars with an initial mass of 13-25 M {\&}sun;, and this affects the final mass-radius relation, basically the final binding energy, at the pre-supernova stage. The elemental yields produced by a generation of stars rotating initially at 300 km s{\textendash}1 do not change substantially with respect to those produced by a generation of non-rotating massive stars, the main differences being a slight overproduction of the weak s-component and a larger production of F. Since rotation also affects the mass-loss rate, either directly or indirectly, we find substantial differences in the lifetimes as O-type and Wolf-Rayet subtypes between the rotating and non-rotating models. The maximum mass exploding as Type IIP supernova ranges between 15 and 20 M {\&}sun; in both sets of models (this value depends basically on the larger mass-loss rates in the red supergiant phase due to the inclusion of the dust-driven wind). This limiting value is in remarkably good agreement with current estimates.},

abstract = {We combine a new, comprehensive database for globular cluster populations in all types of galaxies with a new calibration of galaxy halo masses based entirely on weak lensing. Correlating these two sets of data, we find that the mass ratio $\eta$ $\equiv$ M GCS/M h (total mass in globular clusters, divided by halo mass) is essentially constant at lang$\eta$rang {\textasciitilde} 4 {\texttimes} 10-5, strongly confirming earlier suggestions in the literature. Globular clusters are the only known stellar population that formed in essentially direct proportion to host galaxy halo mass. The intrinsic scatter in $\eta$ appears to be at most 0.2 dex we argue that some of this scatter is due to differing degrees of tidal stripping of the globular cluster systems between central and satellite galaxies. We suggest that this correlation can be understood if most globular clusters form at very early stages in galaxy evolution, largely avoiding the feedback processes that inhibited the bulk of field-star formation in their host galaxies. The actual mean value of $\eta$ also suggests that about one-fourth of the initial gas mass present in protogalaxies collected into giant molecular clouds large enough to form massive, dense star clusters. Finally, our calibration of lang$\eta$rang indicates that the halo masses of the Milky Way and M31 are (1.2 {\textpm} 0.5) {\texttimes} 1012 M ⊙ and (3.9 {\textpm} 1.8) {\texttimes} 1012 M ⊙, respectively.},

abstract = {We present mid-infrared (MIR) observations of the Type II-plateau supernova (SN) 2004et, obtained with the Spitzer Space Telescope between 64 and 1406 days past explosion. Late-time optical spectra are also presented. For the period 300-795 days past explosion, we argue that the spectral energy distribution (SED) of SN 2004et comprises (1) a hot component due to emission from optically thick gas, as well as free-bound radiation; (2) a warm component due to newly formed, radioactively heated dust in the ejecta; and (3) a cold component due to an IR echo from the interstellar-medium dust of the host galaxy, NGC 6946. There may also have been a small contribution to the IR SED due to free-free emission from ionized gas in the ejecta. We reveal the first-ever spectroscopic evidence for silicate dust formed in the ejecta of a supernova. This is supported by our detection of a large, but progressively declining, mass of SiO. However, we conclude that the mass of directly detected ejecta dust grew to no more than a few times 10-4 M sun. We also provide evidence that the ejecta dust formed in comoving clumps of fixed size. We argue that, after about two years past explosion, the appearance of wide, box-shaped optical line profiles was due to the impact of the ejecta on the progenitor circumstellar medium and that the subsequent formation of a cool, dense shell was responsible for a later rise in the MIR flux. This study demonstrates the rich, multifaceted ways in which a typical core-collapse supernova and its progenitor can produce and/or interact with dust grains. The work presented here adds to the growing number of studies that do not support the contention that SNe are responsible for the large mass of observed dust in high-redshift galaxies.},

abstract = {We use medium-band near-infrared (NIR) Hubble Space Telescope WFC3 photometry with model NIR spectra of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars to develop a new tool for efficiently distinguishing carbon-rich (C-type) AGB stars from oxygen-rich (M-type) AGB stars in galaxies at the edge of and outside the Local Group. We present the results of a test of this method on a region of the inner disk of M31, where we find a surprising lack of C stars, contrary to the findings of previous C star searches in other regions of M31. We find only one candidate C star (plus up to six additional, less certain C star candidates), resulting in an extremely low ratio of C to M stars (C/M = (3.3^{+20}_{-0.1})\times 10^{-4}) that is one to two orders of magnitude lower than other C/M estimates in M31. The low C/M ratio is likely due to the high metallicity in this region which impedes stars from achieving C/O > 1 in their atmospheres. These observations provide stringent constraints to evolutionary models of metal-rich AGB stars and suggest that there is a metallicity threshold above which M stars are unable to make the transition to C stars, dramatically affecting AGB mass loss and dust production and, consequently, the observed global properties of metal-rich galaxies.

abstract = {We study the effect of a single, instantaneous starburst on the dynamical and chemical evolution of a gas-rich dwarf galaxy, the potential well of which is dominated by a dark matter halo. We follow the dynamical and chemical evolution of the interstellar medium (ISM) by means of an improved two-dimensional hydrodynamical code coupled with detailed chemical yields originating from type II SNe, type Ia SNe and single low- and intermediate-mass stars (IMS). In particular we follow the evolution of the abundances of H, He, C, N, O, Mg, Si and Fe. We find that for a galaxy resembling IZw18, a galactic wind develops as a consequence of the starburst and it carries out of the galaxy mostly the metal-enriched gas. In addition, we find that different metals are lost differentially in the sense that the elements produced by type Ia SNe are lost more efficiently than others. As a consequence of that, we predict larger [$\alpha$/Fe] ratios for the gas inside the galaxy than for the gas leaving the galaxy. A comparison of our predicted abundances of C, N, O and Si in the case of a burst occurring in a primordial gas shows a very good agreement with the observed abundances in IZw18 as long as the burst has an age of {\textasciitilde}31Myr and IMS produce some primary nitrogen. However, we cannot exclude that a previous burst of star formation had occurred in IZw18, especially if the pre-enrichment produced by the older burst was lower than Z=0.01Zsolar. Finally, at variance with previous studies, we find that most of the metals reside in the cold gas phase already after a few Myr. This result is mainly caused by the assumed low SN II heating efficiency, and justifies the generally adopted homogeneous and instantaneous mixing of gas in chemical evolution models.},

abstract = {Highly ionized fast accretion disc winds have been suggested as an explanation for a variety of observed absorption and emission features in the X-ray spectra of active galactic nuclei. Simple estimates have suggested that these flows may be massive enough to carry away a significant fraction of the accretion energy and could be involved in creating the link between supermassive black holes and their host galaxies. However, testing these hypotheses, and quantifying the outflow signatures, requires high-quality theoretical spectra for comparison with observations. Here, we describe extensions of our Monte Carlo radiative transfer code that allow us to generate realistic theoretical spectra for a much wider variety of disc wind models than that was possible in our previous work. In particular, we have expanded the range of atomic physics simulated by the code so that L- and M-shell ions can now be included. We have also substantially improved our treatment of both ionization and radiative heating such that we are now able to compute spectra for outflows containing far more diverse plasma conditions. We present example calculations that illustrate the variety of spectral features predicted by parametrized outflow models and demonstrate their applicability to the interpretation of data by comparison with observations of the bright quasar PG1211+143. We find that the major features in the observed 2-10 keV spectrum of this object can be well reproduced by our spectra, confirming that it likely hosts a massive outflow.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present the results of a search for members of the globular cluster Palomar 5 and its associated tidal tails. The analysis has been performed using intermediate and low-resolution spectroscopy with the AAOmega spectrograph on the Anglo-Australian Telescope. Based on kinematics, line strength and photometric information, we identify 39 new red giant branch stars along {\~{ }}20{\textdegree} of the tails, a larger angular extent than has been previously studied. We also recover eight previously known tidal tail members. Within the cluster, we find seven new red giant and one blue horizontal branch members and confirm a further 12 known red giant members. In total, we provide velocity data for 67 stars in the cluster and the tidal tails. Using a maximum likelihood technique, we derive a radial velocity for Pal 5 of -57.4 {\textpm} 0.3 km s-1 and a velocity dispersion of 1.2 {\textpm} 0.3 km s-1. We confirm and extend the linear velocity gradient along the tails of 1.0 {\textpm} 0.1 km s-1 deg-1, with an associated intrinsic velocity dispersion of 2.1 {\textpm} 0.4 km s-1. Neither the velocity gradient nor the dispersion change in any significant way with angular distance from the cluster, although there is some indication that the gradient may be smaller at greater angular distances in the trailing tail. Our results verify the tails as kinematically cold structures and will allow further constraints to be placed on the orbit of Pal 5, ultimately permitting a greater understanding of the shape and extent of the Galaxy's dark matter halo.},

abstract = {Aims:The large quantity and high quality of modern radio and infrared line observations require efficient modeling techniques to infer physical and chemical parameters such as temperature, density, and molecular abundances. Methods: We present a computer program to calculate the intensities of atomic and molecular lines produced in a uniform medium, based on statistical equilibrium calculations involving collisional and radiative processes and including radiation from background sources. Optical depth effects are treated with an escape probability method. The program is available on the World Wide Web at http://www.sron.rug.nl/{\textasciitilde}vdtak/radex/index.shtml. The program makes use of molecular data files maintained in the Leiden Atomic and Molecular Database (LAMDA), which will continue to be improved and expanded. Results: The performance of the program is compared with more approximate and with more sophisticated methods. An Appendix provides diagnostic plots to estimate physical parameters from line intensity ratios of commonly observed molecules. Conclusions: This program should form an important tool in analyzing observations from current and future radio and infrared telescopes.

Each cluster also contains two pulsating AGB stars which are infrared sources with a large mass-loss rate. Pulsation masses have been derived for the AGB variables, from the lowest luminosity O-rich variables to the most evolved infrared sources. It is found that the stars in NGC1978 have a mass of 1.55 Msolar early on the AGB while the NGC419 stars have a mass of 1.87 Msolar early on the AGB. These masses are in good agreement with those expected from the cluster ages determined by main-sequence turn-off fitting. Non-linear pulsation models fitted to the highly evolved AGB stars show that a substantial amount of mass-loss has occurred during the AGB evolution of these stars. An examination of the observed mass-loss on the AGB, and the AGB tip luminosities, shows that in both clusters the mass-loss rates computed from the formula of Vassiliadis {\&} Wood reproduce the observations reasonably well. The mass-loss rates computed from the formula of Bl{\"o}cker terminate the AGB in both clusters at a luminosity which is much too low.},

Nevertheless, mass loss on the RGB is still often parameterised by a simple Reimers law in stellar evolution models. Aims: We study the infrared excess and mass loss of a sample of nearby RGB stars with reliably measured Hipparcos parallaxes and compare the mass loss to that derived for luminous stars in clusters. Methods: The spectral energy distributions of a well-defined sample of 54 RGB stars are constructed, and fitted with the dust radiative transfer model DUSTY. The central stars are modelled by MARCS model atmospheres. In a first step, the best-fit MARCS model is derived, basically determining the effective temperature. In a second step, models with a finite dust optical depth are fitted and it is determined whether the reduction in $\chi$2 in such models with one additional free parameter is statistically significant. Results: Among the 54 stars, 23 stars are found to have a significant infrared excess, which is interpreted as mass loss. The most luminous star with L = 1860 L⊙ is found to undergo mass loss, while none of the 5 stars with L < 262 L⊙ display evidence of mass loss. In the range 265 < L < 1500 L⊙, 22 stars out of 48 experience mass loss, which supports the notion of episodic mass loss. It is the first time that excess emission is found in stars fainter than {\textasciitilde}600 L⊙. The dust optical depths are translated into mass-loss rates assuming a typical expansion velocity of 10 km s-1 and a dust-to-gas ratio of 0.005. In this case, fits to the stars with an excess result in log {\.{M}} (M⊙ yr-1) = (1.4 {\textpm} 0.4)log L + (-13.2 {\textpm} 1.2) and log {\.{M}} (M⊙ yr-1) = (0.9 {\textpm} 0.3)log (LR/M) + (-13.4 {\textpm} 1.3) assuming a mass of 1.1 M⊙ for all objects. We caution that if the expansion velocity and dust-to-gas ratio have different values from those assumed, the constants in the fit will change. If these parameters are also functions of luminosity, then this would affect both the slopes and the offsets. The mass-loss rates are compared to those derived for luminous stars in globular clusters, by fitting both the infrared excess, as in the present paper, and the chromospheric lines. There is excellent agreement between these values and the mass-loss rates derived from the chromospheric activity. There is a systematic difference with the literature mass-loss rates derived from modelling the infrared excess, and this has been traced to technical details on how the DUSTY radiative transfer model is run. If the present results are combined with those from modelling the chromospheric emission lines, we obtain the fits log {\.{M}} (M⊙ yr-1) = (1.0 {\textpm} 0.3)log L + (-12.0 {\textpm} 0.9) and log {\.{M}} (M⊙ yr-1) = (0.6 {\textpm} 0.2)log (LR/M) + (-11.9 {\textpm} 0.9), and find that the metallicity dependence is weak at best. The predictions of these mass-loss rate formula are tested against the recent RGB mass loss determination in NGC 6791. Using a scaling factor of {\textasciitilde}10 {\textpm} {\textasciitilde}5, both relations can fit this value. That the scaling factor is larger than unity suggests that the expansion velocity and/or dust-to-gas ratio, or even the dust opacities, are different from the values adopted. Angular diameters are presented for the sample. They may serve as calibrators in interferometric observations. Appendix A and Table 4 are available in electronic form at http://www.aanda.org},

abstract = {By using updated stellar low-mass stars models, we systematically investigate the nucleosynthesis processes occurring in asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. In this paper, we present a database dedicated to the nucleosynthesis of AGB stars: FRANEC Repository of Updated Isotopic Tables {\&} Yields (FRUITY). An interactive Web-based interface allows users to freely download the full (from H to Bi) isotopic composition, as it changes after each third dredge-up (TDU) episode and the stellar yields the models produce. A first set of AGB models, having masses in the range 1.5 <=M/M {\&}sun; <= 3.0 and metallicities 1 {\texttimes} 10-3 <= Z <= 2 {\texttimes} 10-2, is discussed. For each model, a detailed description of the physical and the chemical evolution is provided. In particular, we illustrate the details of the s-process and we evaluate the theoretical uncertainties due to the parameterization adopted to model convection and mass loss. The resulting nucleosynthesis scenario is checked by comparing the theoretical [hs/ls] and [Pb/hs] ratios to those obtained from the available abundance analysis of s-enhanced stars. On the average, the variation with the metallicity of these spectroscopic indexes is well reproduced by theoretical models, although the predicted spread at a given metallicity is substantially smaller than the observed one. Possible explanations for such a difference are briefly discussed. An independent check of the TDU efficiency is provided by the C-stars luminosity function. Consequently, theoretical C-stars luminosity functions for the Galactic disk and the Magellanic Clouds have been derived. We generally find good agreement with observations.},

abstract = {The theory underlying the evolution and death of stars heavier than 10 M⊙ on the main sequence is reviewed with an emphasis upon stars much heavier than 30 M⊙. These are stars that, in the absence of substantial mass loss, are expected to either produce black holes when they die, or, for helium cores heavier than about 35 M⊙, encounter the pair instability. A wide variety of outcomes is possible depending upon the initial composition of the star, its rotation rate, and the physics used to model its evolution. These stars can produce some of the brightest supernovae in the universe, but also some of the faintest. They can make gamma-ray bursts or collapse without a whimper. Their nucleosynthesis can range from just CNO to a broad range of elements up to the iron group. Though rare nowadays, they probably played a disproportionate role in shaping the evolution of the universe following the formation of its first stars.},

abstract = {Recent studies have shown that the observed main-sequence turnoff (MSTO) in colour-magnitude diagrams of intermediate-age (1-2 Gyr) clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is broader than would be nominally expected for a simple stellar population. This has led to the suggestion that such clusters may host multiple stellar populations, with age spreads of 100-500 Myr. However, at intermediate ages, spreads of this magnitude are difficult to discern and alternative explanations have been put forward (e.g. stellar rotation, interacting binaries). A prediction of the age-spread scenario is that younger clusters in the LMC, with similar masses and radii, should also show significant age spreads. In younger clusters (i.e. 40-300 Myr), such large age spreads should be readily apparent. We present an analysis of the colour-magnitude diagrams of two massive young clusters in the LMC (NGC 1856 and NGC 1866) and show that neither have such large age spreads; in fact, both are consistent with a single burst of star formation [$\sigma$(age) < 35 Myr]. This leads us to conclude that either the intermediate-age clusters in the LMC are somehow special or the broadened MSTOs are not due to an age spread within the clusters.},

Results are given as a function of one pair of state variables, (i.e. temperature T in the range 3.2 $\le$ log(T) $\le$ 4.5, and parameter R= $\rho$/(T/106 K)3 in the range -8 $\le$ log(R) $\le$ 1), and arbitrary chemical mixture. The chemistry is presently solved for about 800 species, consisting of almost 300 atomic and 500 molecular species. The gas opacities account for many continuum and discrete sources, including atomic opacities, molecular absorption bands, and collision-induced absorption. Several tests made on {\AE}SOPUS have proved that the new opacity tool is accurate in the results, flexible in the management of the input prescriptions, and agile in terms of computational time requirement. Purpose of this work is to greatly expand the public availability of Rosseland mean opacity data in the low-temperature regime. We set up a web-interface (http://stev.oapd.inaf.it/aesopus) which enables the user to compute and shortly retrieve RM opacity tables according to his/her specific needs, allowing a full degree of freedom in specifying the chemical composition of the gas. As discussed in the paper, useful applications may regard, for instance, RM opacities of gas mixtures with i) scaled-solar abundances of metals, choosing among various solar mixture compilations available in the literature; ii) varying CNO abundances, suitable for evolutionary models of red and asymptotic giant branch stars and massive stars in the Wolf-Rayet stages; iii) various degrees of enhancement in $\alpha$-elements, and C-N, O-Na, and Mg-Al abundance anti-correlations, necessary to properly describe the properties of stars in early-type galaxies and Galactic globular clusters; iv) zero-metal abundances appropriate for studies of gas opacity in primordial conditions.},

abstract = {We compute the evolution of different abundance ratios in the Milky Way (MW) for two different sets of stellar yields. In one of them stellar rotation is taken into account and we investigate its effects on the chemical evolution model predictions. Moreover, we show that some abundance ratios offer an important tool to investigate the halo-disk discontinuity. For the first time it is shown that the effect of a halt in the star formation between the halo/thick disk and thin disk phases, already suggested from studies based both on Fe/O vs. O/H and Fe/Mg vs. Mg/H, should also be seen in a C/O versus O/H plot if C is produced mainly by low- and intermediate-mass stars (LIMS). The idea that C originates mainly from LIMS is suggested by the flat behavior of the [C/Fe] ratio as a function of metallicity, from [Fe/H] {\textasciitilde} -2.2 to solar, and by the fact that very recent C/O measurements for stars in the MW halo and disk seem to show a discontinuity around log (O/H) + 12 {\textasciitilde} 8.4. Finally, a more gentle increase of N abundance with metallicity (or time), relative to models adopting the yields of van den Hoek {\&} Groenewegen (\cite{Hoe97}), is predicted by using the stellar yields of Meynet {\&} Maeder (\cite{Mey02} - which include stellar rotation but not hot-bottom burning) for intermediate mass stars. This fact has some implications for the timescales of N enrichment and thus for the interpretation of the nature of Damped Lyman Alpha Systems.

abstract = {Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars play a fundamental role in s-process nucleosynthesis during their thermal pulsing phase. The theoretical predictions obtained by AGB models at different masses, s-process efficiencies, dilution factors and initial r-enrichment, are compared with spectroscopic observations of Carbon-Enhanced Metal-Poor stars enriched in s-process elements, CEMP(s), collected from the literature. We discuss here five stars as example, CS 22880-074, CS 22942-019, CS 29526-110, HE 0202-2204 and LP 625-44. All these objects lie on the main sequence or on the giant phase, clearly before the thermally pulsing AGB stage. The hypothesis of mass transfer from an AGB companion, would explain the observed s-process enhancement. CS 29526-110 and LP 625-44 are CEMP(s + r) objects, and are interpreted assuming that the molecular cloud, from which the binary system formed, was already enriched in r-process elements by SNII pollution. In several cases, the observed s-process distribution may be accounted for by AGB models of different initial masses with proper 13C-pocket efficiencies and dilution factors. Na (and Mg), produced via the neutron capture chain starting from 22Ne, may provide an indicator of the initial AGB mass.},

abstract = {Transition probabilities governing the interaction of energy packets and matter are derived that allow Monte Carlo NLTE transfer codes to be constructed without simplifying the treatment of line formation. These probabilities are such that the Monte Carlo calculation asymptotically recovers the local emissivity of a gas in statistical equilibrium. Numerical experiments with one-point statistical equilibrium problems for Fe II and Hydrogen confirm this asymptotic behaviour. In addition, the resulting Monte Carlo emissivities are shown to be far less sensitive to errors in the populations of the emitting levels than are the values obtained with the basic emissivity formula.},

abstract = {Context. The abundance inhomogeneities of light elements observed in globular clusters (GCs), and notably the ubiquitous Na-O anti-correlation, are generally interpreted as evidence that GCs comprise several generations of stars. There is an on-going debate as to the nature of the stars, which produce the inhomogeneous elements, and investigating the behavior of several elements is a way to shed new light on this problem. Aims: We aim at investigating the Li and Na content of the GC M 4, that is known to have a well defined Na-O anti-correlation. Methods: We obtained moderate resolution (R = 17 000-18 700) spectra for 91 main sequence (MS)/sub-giant branch stars of M 4 with the Giraffe spectrograph at the FLAMES/VLT ESO facility. Using model atmospheres analysis we measured lithium and sodium abundances. Results: We detect a weak Li-Na anti-correlation among un-evolved MS stars. One star in the sample, {\#} 37934, shows the remarkably high lithium abundance A(Li) = 2.87, compatible with current estimates of the primordial lithium abundance. Conclusions: The shallow slope found for the Li-Na anti-correlation suggests that lithium is produced in parallel to sodium. This evidence, coupled with its sodium-rich nature, suggests that the high lithium abundance of star {\#} 37934 may originate by pollution from a previous generations of stars. The recent detection of a Li-rich dwarf of pollution origin in the globular cluster NGC 6397 may also point in this direction. Still, no clear cut evidence is available against a possible preservation of the primordial lithium abundance for star {\#} 37934.

abstract = {Context. NGC 4372 is a poorly studied old, very metal-poor globular cluster (GC) located in the inner Milky Way halo. Aims: We present the first in-depth study of the kinematic properties and derive the structural parameters of NGC 4372 based on the fit of a Plummer profile and a rotating, physical model. We explore the link between internal rotation to different cluster properties and together with similar studies of more GCs, we put these in the context of globular cluster formation and evolution. Methods: We present radial velocities for 131 cluster member stars measured from high-resolution FLAMES/GIRAFFE observations. Their membership to the GC is additionally confirmed from precise metallicity estimates. We build a velocity dispersion profile and a systemic rotation curve using this kinematic data set. Additionally, we obtain an elliptical number density profile of NGC 4372 based on optical images using a Markov chain Monte Carlo fitting algorithm. From this, we derive the cluster's half-light radius and ellipticity as rh = 3.44' {\textpm} 0.04' and e = 0.08 {\textpm} 0.01. Finally, we give a physical interpretation of the observed morphological and kinematic properties of this GC by fitting an axisymmetric, differentially rotating, dynamical model. Results: Our results show that NGC 4372 has an unusually high ratio of rotation amplitude to velocity dispersion (1.2 vs. 4.5 km s-1) for its metallicity. This puts it in line, however, with two other exceptional, very metal-poor GCs: M 15 and NGC 4590. We also find a mild flattening of NGC 4372 in the direction of its rotation. Given its old age, this suggests that the flattening is indeed caused by the systemic rotation rather than tidal interactions with the Galaxy. Additionally, we estimate the dynamical mass of the GC Mdyn = 2.0 {\textpm} 0.5 {\texttimes} 105M⊙ based on the dynamical model, which constrains the mass-to-light ratio of NGC 4372 between 1.4 and 2.3 M⊙/L⊙, representative of an old, purely stellar population.

abstract = {Aims: Fluorine is a fairly good tracer of formation histories of multiple stellar populations in globular clusters as already revealed by several studies. Large variations in fluorine abundance in red giant stars of the globular cluster M 22 have been recently reported by two different groups. Futhermore, one of these studies claims that the abundance of fluorine is anti-correlated with sodium abundances in this cluster, leading to strong conclusions on the chemical history of M 22. To validate this important finding, we re-examine the F abundance determinations of some of the previously studied stars. Methods: We have reanalysed some high-resolution VLT/CRIRES spectra of RGB stars found in M 22 in order to re-estimate their fluorine abundance from the spectral synthesis of the HF line at 2.336 $\mu$m. Results: Unlike what has been previously estimated, we show that only upper limits or doubtful fluorine abundances with large uncertainties in M 22 RGB stars can be derived. This is caused by an incorrect identification of continuum fluctuations as the HF signature combined with a wrong correction of the stellar radial velocity. Such continuum fluctuations could be the consequences of telluric residuals that are still present in the analysed spectra. Therefore, no definitive conclusions on the chemical pollution caused by the M 22 first stellar generation can presently be drawn from the fluorine content of this cluster.},

abstract = {Up to now, iron had not been found in any hydrogen-deficient (pre-) white dwarf of spectral type PG1159, despite intense searching in a number of objects. Consequently, an iron deficiency was claimed, in some cases at least 1 dex. The primary indicators were UV lines of Fe VII. Therefore, the search was confined to relatively cool PG1159 stars (T eff lsim150,000 K), otherwise Fe is too strongly ionized for a significant population of Fe VII. In this Letter, we announce the discovery of iron in the very hottest PG1159 stars (T eff = 150,000-200,000 K RX J2117.1+3412, K 1-16, Longmore 4, NGC 246, H1504+65), based on the identification of the Fe X $\lambda$$\lambda$979.3, 1022.9 lines in spectra obtained with the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer. Surprisingly, our analysis results in a solar iron abundance for these stars. It is conspicuous that they are among the most massive PG1159 stars (0.71-0.82 M sun), in contrast to those objects for which strongest Fe deficiency was claimed (0.53-0.56 M sun).},

abstract = {Aims: Recently, the study of globular cluster (GC) color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) has shown that some of them harbor multiple populations with different chemical compositions and/or ages. In the first case, the most common candidate is a spread in the initial helium abundance, but this quantity is difficult to determine spectroscopically due to the fact that helium absorption lines are not present in cooler stars, whereas for hotter GC stars gravitational settling of helium becomes important. As a consequence, indirect methods to determine the initial helium abundance among populations are necessary. For that reason, in this series of papers, we investigate the effects of a helium enrichment in populations covering the range of GC metallicities. Methods: In this first paper, we present the theoretical evolutionary tracks, isochrones, and zero-age horizontal branch (ZAHB) loci calculated with the Princeton-Goddard-PUC (PGPUC) stellar evolutionary code, which has been updated with the most recent input physics and compared with other theoretical databases. The chemical composition grid covers 9 metallicities ranging from Z = 1.60 {\texttimes} 10-4 to 1.57 {\texttimes} 10-2(-2.25 ≲ [Fe/H] ≲ -0.25), 7 helium abundances from Y = 0.230 to 0.370, and an alpha-element enhancement of [$\alpha$/Fe] = 0.3. Results: The effects of different helium abundances that can be observed in isochrones are: splits in the main sequence (MS), differences in the luminosity (L) and effective temperature (Teff) of the turn off point, splits in the sub giant branch being more prominent for lower ages or higher metallicities, splits in the lower red giant branch (RGB) being more prominent for higher ages or higher metallicities, differences in L of the RGB bump (with small changes in Teff), and differences in L at the RGB tip. At the ZAHB, when Y is increased there is an increase of L for low Teff, which is affected in different degrees depending on the age of the GC being studied. Finally, the ZAHB morphology distribution depending on the age explains how for higher GC metallicities a population with higher helium abundance could be hidden at the red ZAHB locus.

abstract = {Context. In recent years mid- and far infrared spectra of planetary nebulae have been analysed and lead to more accurate abundances. It may be expected that these better abundances lead to a better understanding of the evolution of these objects. Aims: The observed abundances in planetary nebulae are compared to those predicted by the models of Karakas (2003, Thesis, Monash Univ. Melbourne) in order to predict the progenitor masses of the various PNe used. The morphology of the PNe is included in the comparison. Since the central stars play an important role in the evolution, it is expected that this comparison will yield additional information about them. Methods: First the nitrogen/oxygen ratio is discussed with relation to the helium/hydrogen ratio. The progenitor mass for each PNe can be found by a comparison with the models of Karakas. Then the present luminosity of the central stars is determined in two ways: first by computing the central star effective temperature and radius, and second by computing the nebular luminosity from the hydrogen and helium lines. This luminosity is also a function of the initial mass so that these two values of initial mass can be compared. Results: Six of the seven bipolar nebulae can be identified as descendants of high mass stars (4-6 M{\&}sun;) while the seventh is ambiguous. Most of the elliptical PNe have central stars which descend from low initial mass stars, although there are a few caveats which are discussed. There is no observational evidence for a higher mass for central stars which have a high carbon/oxygen ratio. The evidence provided by the abundance comparison with the models of Karakas is consistent with the HR diagram to which it is compared. In the course of this discussion it is shown how "optically thin" nebulae can be separated from those which are "optically thick".

abstract = {We discuss possible stellar origins of short-lived radioactive nuclei with meanlife $\tau$ <= 100Myr, which were shown to be alive in the Early Solar System (ESS). We first review current ideas on the production of nuclides having 10 <= $\tau$ <= 100Myr, which presumably derive from the continuous interplay of galactic astration, nucleosynthesis from massive supernovae and free decay in the interstellar medium. The abundance of the shorter lived 53Mn might be explained by this same scenario. Then we consider the nuclei 107Pd, 26Al, 41Ca and 60Fe, whose early solar system abundances are too high to have originated in this way. Present evidence favours a stellar origin, particularly for 107Pd, 26Al and 60Fe, rather than an in situ production by energetic solar particles. The idea of an encounter (rather close in time and space) between the forming Sun and a dying star is therefore discussed: this star may or may not have also triggered the solar formation. Recent nucleosynthesis calculations for the yields of the relevant short-lived isotopes and of their stable reference nuclei are discussed. Massive stars evolving to type II supernovae (either leaving a neutron star or a black hole as a remnant) seem incapable of explaining the four most critical ESS radioactivities in their observed abundance ratios. An asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star seems to be a viable source, especially if of relatively low initial mass (M <= 3Modot) and with low neutron exposure: this model can provide a solution for 26Al, 41Ca and 107Pd, with important contributions to 60Fe, which are inside the present uncertainty range of the 60Fe early solar system abundance. Such a model requires that 26Al is produced substantially on the AGB by cool bottom processing. The remaining inventory of short-lived species in the solar nebula would then be attributed to the continuous galactic processing, with the exception of 10Be, which must reflect production by later proton bombardment at a low level during early solar history.},

abstract = {Depending on mass and metallicity as well as evolutionary phase, stars occasionally experience convective-reactive nucleosynthesis episodes. We specifically investigate the situation when nucleosynthetically unprocessed, H-rich material is convectively mixed with an He-burning zone, for example in a convectively unstable shell on top of electron-degenerate cores in asymptotic giant branch stars, young white dwarfs, or X-ray bursting neutron stars. Such episodes are frequently encountered in stellar evolution models of stars of extremely low or zero metal content, such as the first stars. We have carried out detailed nucleosynthesis simulations based on stellar evolution models and informed by hydrodynamic simulations. We focus on the convective-reactive episode in the very late thermal pulse star Sakurai's object (V4334 Sagittarii). Asplund et al. determined the abundances of 28 elements, many of which are highly non-solar, ranging from H, He, and Li all the way to Ba and La, plus the C isotopic ratio. Our simulations show that the mixing evolution according to standard, one-dimensional stellar evolution models implies neutron densities in the He intershell (lsim few 1011 cm-3) that are too low to obtain a significant neutron capture nucleosynthesis on the heavy elements. We have carried out three-dimensional hydrodynamic He-shell flash convection simulations in 4$\pi$ geometry to study the entrainment of H-rich material. Guided by these simulations we assume that the ingestion process of H into the He-shell convection zone leads only after some delay time to a sufficient entropy barrier that splits the convection zone into the original one driven by He burning and a new one driven by the rapid burning of ingested H. By making such mixing assumptions that are motivated by our hydrodynamic simulations we obtain significantly higher neutron densities ({\textasciitilde} few 1015 cm-3) and reproduce the key observed abundance trends found in Sakurai's object. These include an overproduction of Rb, Sr, and Y by about two orders of magnitude higher than the overproduction of Ba and La. Such a peculiar nucleosynthesis signature is impossible to obtain with the mixing predictions in our one-dimensional stellar evolution models. The simulated Li abundance and the isotopic ratio 12C/13C are as well in agreement with observations. Details of the observed heavy element abundances can be used as a sensitive diagnostic tool for the neutron density, for the neutron exposure and, in general, for the physics of the convective-reactive phases in stellar evolution. For example, the high elemental ratio Sc/Ca and the high Sc production indicate high neutron densities. The diagnostic value of such abundance markers depends on uncertain nuclear physics input. We determine how our results depend on uncertainties of nuclear reaction rates, for example for the 13C($\alpha$, n)16O reaction.},

We introduce the concept of a viscous mesh in order to improve the numerical stability of the calculations. For the 5-Msolar star, we evolve through 25 thermal pulses and their associated third dredge-up events. We obtain a maximum helium luminosity of 1.7 {\texttimes} 109 Lsolar and significantly deep dredge-up after the second pulse. Strong hot-bottom burning is observed after the fifth pulse. The 3-Msolar model is evolved through 20 thermal pulse events, and we find third dredge-up after the seventh pulse. During the 14th pulse, sufficient carbon has been brought to the surface to produce a carbon star. We find that dredge-up and the transformation into a carbon star occur at significantly smaller core masses (0.584 and 0.608 Msolar, respectively) than in previous calculations for 3 Msolar.},

abstract = {The third dredge-up phenomenon in asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars is analyzed through evolutionary model calculations of a \mass{3}, solar metallicity star. The Schwarzschild criterion is used to test the stability of a given layer against convection, and the calculations are performed either with or without extra-mixing below the convective envelope. Based on these calculations, several questions are addressed regarding the occurrence of the third dredge-up in AGB star models, the laws governing that phenomenon, and some of its implications on the structural and chemical evolution of those stars. The use of the Schwarzschild criterion without extra-mixing of any sort is shown to lead to unphysical afterpulse models which prevent the occurrence of third dredge-up. Model calculations of a \mass{3} star using no extra-mixing confirm the failure to obtain dredge-up in those conditions. That conclusion is found to be independent of the mixing length parameter, stellar mass, or numerical accuracy of the models. Model calculations performed on selected afterpulses of the \mass{3} star, but with extra-mixing (using a decreasing bubble velocity field in the radiative layers and a diffusion algorithm for the mixing of the chemical elements), lead to efficient dredge-ups at a rate of \mass{10^{-5}-10^{-4}}/yr. Test calculations using different extra-mixing extents and efficiencies reveal that the dredge-up predictions are rather insensitive to those extra-mixing parameters. This important conclusion is understood by analyzing the physics involved in the dredge-up process. It is shown that the dredge-up rate is determined by the thermal relaxation time-scale of the envelope as C-rich matter is added from the core into the envelope. The dredge-up predictions are, however, expected to depend on the convection prescription in the envelope. Linear relations both between the dredge-up rate and the core mass M_c and between the dredge-up efficiency lambda and M_c are predicted by the model calculations. Those linear relations are expected to still hold when the feedback of the dredge-ups on the AGB evolution is taken into account. They predict the dredge-up efficiency to level off at unity during the AGB evolution, at which point the core mass remains constant from one pulse to the next. The core mass is concomitantly predicted to evolve towards an asymptotic value. The existence of such an asymptotic core mass naturally provides an upper limit to the mass of the white dwarf remnant, and helps to constrain the initial-final mass of white dwarfs. Synthetic calculations taking into account the dredge-up laws obtained from the full AGB model calculations predict a continuous increase of the stellar luminosity L with time, contrary to the predicted behavior of M_c and lambda . This results from an adopted dependence of L on both M_c and the radius R_c of the H-depleted core of the form L{\textasciitilde} M_c(2/R_c) . As a result of this increase of L with time, the initial-final mass relation can further be constrained if mass loss is taken into account. If, for example, a superwind is assumed to eject all the remaining envelope of the \mass{3} star at \lsun{L=15000}, then the mass of the white dwarf remnant is predicted to be \mass{0.66}, instead of \mass{0.73} predicted by models without dredge-up. Finally, the synthetic calculations predict the formation of a \mass{3} carbon star after about 20 pulses experiencing dredge-up. Taking into account the fact that the luminosity decreases by a factor of two during about 20% of the interpulse phases, such a \mass{3} carbon star could be observed at luminosities as low as \lsun{7500}.},

abstract = {Stars in the mass range {\textasciitilde}8 - 12 $M_{\odot }$ are the most numerous massive stars. This mass range is critical because it may lead to supernova (SN) explosion, so it is important for the production of heavy elements and the chemical evolution of the galaxy. We investigate the critical transition mass ($M_{up}$), which is the minimum initial stellar mass that attains the conditions for hydrostatic carbon burning. Stars of masses < $M_{up}$ evolve to the Asymptotic Giant Branch and then develop CO White Dwarfs, while stars of masses $\geqslant $ $M_{up}$ ignite carbon in a partially degenerate CO core and form electron degenerate ONe cores. These stars evolve to the Super AGB (SAGB) phase and either become progenitors of ONe White Dwarfs or eventually explode as electron-capture SN (EC-SN). We study the sensitivity of $M_{up}$ to the C-burning reaction rate and to the treatment of convective mixing. In particular, we show the effect of a recent determination of the $^{12}C+$ $^{12}C$ fusion rate, as well as the extension of the convective core during hydrogen and helium burning on $M_{up}$ in solar metallicity stars. We choose the 9$M_{\odot }$ model to show the detailed characteristics of the evolution with the new C-burning rate.},

abstract = {For centuries, we have known that our dynamic universe is adorned by cosmic fireworks: energetic and ephemeral beacons of light from a single star that are a million (nova) to a billion (supernova) times brighter than our sun. However, it had been an age-old conundrum that the brightest nova is approximately 1000 times fainter than than the faintest supernova; why should nature leave such a wide "gap"? In search of an answer, I undertook three systematic surveys for my thesis. Since I was looking for transients fainter, faster and rarer than supernovae, I focused my search on galaxies in the local universe. We now have convincing evidence of multiple, distinct populations of rare transients bridging this "gap". Perhaps, we are witnessing new stellar physics --- shell detonations in ultra-compact white dwarf binaries, electron-capture supernovae, white dwarfs collapsing into neutron stars and birth of black-holes. A small number of intensively followed-up discoveries of elusive transients sets the stage for population studies with the upcoming "Large Synoptic Survey Telescope". This effort works towards building a complete inventory of transients in the local universe (d < 200 Mpc). It better prepares us for the search for potential electromagnetic counterparts to events in the emerging fields of gravitational wave, neutrino and ultra high energy cosmic ray astronomy as these experiments are also limited to the local universe.},

abstract = {We investigate the behavior and consequences of the reverse shock that terminates the supersonic expansion of the baryonic wind which is driven by neutrino heating off the surface of (non-magnetized) new-born neutron stars in supernova cores. To this end we perform long-time hydrodynamic simulations in spherical symmetry. In agreement with previous relativistic wind studies, we find that the neutrino-driven outflow accelerates to supersonic velocities and in case of a compact, {\textasciitilde}1.4 M_⊙ (gravitational mass) neutron star with a radius of about 10 km, the wind reaches entropies of about 100 kB per nucleon. The wind, however, is strongly influenced by the environment of the supernova core. It is decelerated and shock-heated abruptly by a termination shock that forms when the supersonic outflow collides with the slower preceding supernova ejecta. The radial position of this reverse shock varies with time and depends on the strength of the neutrino wind and the explosion conditions in progenitor stars with different masses and structure. Its basic properties and behavior can be understood by simple analytic considerations. We demonstrate that the entropy of the matter going through the reverse shock can increase to a multiple of the asymptotic wind value. Seconds after the onset of the explosion it therefore can exceed 400 kB per nucleon in low-mass progenitors around 10 M_⊙, where the supernova shock and the reverse shock propagate outward quickly. The temperature of the shocked wind has typically dropped to about or less than 109 K, and density and temperature in the shock-decelerated matter continue to decrease only very slowly. For more massive progenitors with bigger and denser metal cores, the explosion expands more slowly so that the termination shock stays at smaller radii and affects the wind at higher temperatures and densities. In this case the termination shock might play a non-negligible, strongly time- and progenitor-dependent role in discussing supernova nucleosynthesis.},

abstract = {Absolute magnitudes are estimated for carbon stars of various subtypes in the Hipparcos catalogue and as found in the Magellanic Clouds. Stellar radii fall within the limits of 2.4-4.7 AU. The chemical composition of carbon stars indicates that the C-N stars show nearly solar C/H, N/H, and ^12C/^13C ratios. This indicates that much of the C and N in our Galaxy came from mass-losing carbon stars. Special carbon stars such as the C-R, C-H, and dC stars are described. Mass loss from asymptotic giant branch (AGB) carbon stars, at rates up to several x 10^-5 M{solar} year^-1, contributes about half of the total mass return to the interstellar medium. R stars do not lose mass and may be carbon-rich red giants. The mass loss rates for Miras are about 10 times higher than for SRb and Lb stars, whose properties are similar enough to show that they are likely to belong to the same population. The distribution of carbon star mass loss rates peaks at about 10^-7 M{solar} year^-1, close to the rate of growth of the core mass and demonstrative of the close relationship between mass loss and evolution. Infrared spectroscopy shows that dust mixtures can occur. Detached shells are seen around some stars; they appear to form on the time scales of the helium shell flashes and to be a normal occurrence in carbon star evolution.},

abstract = {We present new computations of the evolution of solar metallicity stars in the mass range 9 - 12 M{\&}sun;. This first paper of a series focuses on the propagation of the carbon burning flame front and provides a detailed analysis of the structural evolution up to the formation of the neon-oxygen core. Our calculations which do not include overshooting indicate that off-center carbon ignition is restricted to a small mass range between 9.0 and 11.3 M{\&}sun;. The chemical imprints of the first and second dredge-ups on the surface composition are analyzed and compared to "standard" less massive stars. It results that, aside from being more luminous and slightly bluer in the HR diagram, massive AGB stars are almost indistinguishable from their lower mass counterparts, as far as the chemical composition is concerned. During the second dredge-up, we note however that the envelope penetrates deeper into the He burning shell than lower mass stars. Our simulations indicate that above 11.0 M{\&}sun;, the depth of the second dredge up is considerably reduced, marking the transition between low and massive stars. We also investigate the effects of the nuclear uncertainties associated with 12{{C}} + 12{{C}} reactions and show that it has a little impact on the core composition. Finally we describe the nucleosynthesis and chemical structure of the newly formed neon-oxygen core.},

First the computations were made under the assumption that the stars do not lose mass. These computations were started on the main sequence and carried out through the phases of hydrogen and helium exhaustion in the center. Models of 10 and 15 M_odot ignited carbon in the center nonviolently. Stars of 3, 5 and 7 M_odot ignited carbon in the center at the density of 3x10^9 g/cm^3. This will probably lead to the type of thermonuclear supernova explosion suggested by Arnett. Also, the 1.5 M_odot model is expected to ignite carbon under similar conditions. When dynamical instability of red supergiant envelopes was taken into account, the models of 0.8, 1.5 and 3 M_odot lost their envelopes during the double shell burning phase. The masses of the remaining cores were 0.6, 0.8 and 1.2 M_odot respectively. These cores evolved through the part of the H-R diagram occupied by the nuclei of planetary nebulae, and were finally cooling down and evolving towards thewhite dwarf region.},

abstract = {Absolute magnitudes in the B, V, and I bands are derived for nine well-observed Type Ia supernovae, using host galaxy distances estimated via the surface brightness fluctuations or Tully-Fisher methods. These data indicate that there is a significant intrinsic dispersion in the absolute magnitudes at maximum light of Type Ia supernovae, amounting to +/- 0.8 mag in B, +/- 0.6 mag in V, and +/- 0.5 mag in I. Moreover, the absolute magnitudes appear to be tightly correlated with the initial rate of decline of the B light curve, with the slope of the correlation being steepest in B and becoming progressively flatter in the V and I bands. This implies that the intrinsic B - V colors of Type Ia supernovae at maximum light are not identical, with the fastest declining light curves corresponding to the intrinsically reddest events. Certain spectroscopic properties may also be correlated with the initial decline rate. These results are most simply interpreted as evidence for a range of progenitor masses, although variations in the explosion mechanism are also possible. Considerable care must be exercised in employing Type Ia supernovae as cosmological standard candles, particularly at large redshifts where Malmquist bias could be an important effect.},

These calculations, in which we find third dredge-up and hot bottom burning, fill the gap between existing low- and intermediate-mass AGB star models and high-mass star models that become supernovae. For the considered metallicities, the composition of the yields is largely dominated by the thermodynamic conditions at the base of the convective envelope rather than by the pollution arising from third dredge-up. We investigate the effects of various uncertainties, related to the mass-loss rate, mixing length parameter, and the treatment of evolution after the envelope instability that develops near the end of the (super)AGB phase. Varying these parameters alters the yields mainly because of their impact on the amount of third dredge-up enrichment, and to a lesser extent on the hot bottom burning conditions. Our models produce significant amounts of 4He, 7Li (depending on the mass-loss formulation) 13C, 14N, 17O, 23Na, 25Mg, as well the radioactive isotope 26Al in agreement with previous investigation. In addition, our results show enrichment of 22Ne, 26Mg and 60Fe, as well as a substantial increase in our proxy neutron capture species representing all species heavier than iron. These stars may provide important contributions to the Galaxy's inventory of the heavier Mg isotopes, 14N, 7Li and 27Al.},

abstract = {In the first paper of this series, we proposed a new framework in which to model the chemical evolution of globular clusters. This model is predicated upon the assumption that clusters form within an interstellar medium enriched locally by the ejecta of a single Type Ia supernova and varying numbers of asymptotic giant branch stars, superimposed on an ambient medium pre-enriched by low-metallicity Type II supernovae. Paper I was concerned with the application of this model to the observed abundances of several reactive elements and so-called non-metals for three classical intermediate-metallicity clusters, with the hallmark of the work being the successful recovery of many of their well-known elemental and isotopic abundance anomalies. Here, we expand upon our initial analysis by (i) applying the model to a much broader range of metallicities (from the factor of 3 explored in Paper I, to now a factor of {\~{ }}50; i.e. essentially, the full range of Galactic globular cluster abundances; and (ii) incorporating a broader suite of chemical species, including a number of iron-peak isotopes, heavier $\alpha$-elements and fluorine. While allowing for an appropriate fine-tuning of the model input parameters, most empirical globular cluster abundance trends are reproduced; our model would suggest the need for a higher production of calcium, silicon and copper in low-metallicity (or so-called 'prompt') Type Ia supernovae than predicted in current stellar models in order to reproduce the observed trends in NGC 6752, and a factor of 2 reduction in carbon production from asymptotic giant branch stars to explain the observed trends between carbon and nitrogen. Observations of heavy-element isotopes produced primarily by Type Ia supernovae, including those of titanium, iron and nickel, could support/refute unequivocally our proposed framework, although currently the feasibility of the proposed observations is well beyond current instrumental capabilities. Hydrodynamical simulations would be necessary to study its viability from a dynamical point of view.},

abstract = {The astrophysical nature of r-process sites is a long-standing mystery and many probable sources have been suggested, among them lower-mass core-collapse supernovae (in the range 8-10 {M}⊙), higher-mass core-collapse supernovae (with masses $\ge$20 {M}⊙) and neutron star mergers. In this work, we present a detailed inhomogeneous chemical evolution study that considers for the first time neutron star mergers as major r-process sources, and compare this scenario to the ones in which core-collapse supernovae act as dominant r-process sites. We conclude that, due to the lack of reliable iron and r-process yields as a function of progenitor mass, it is not possible at present to distinguish between the lower-mass and higher-mass supernovae scenarios within the framework of inhomogeneous chemical evolution. However, neutron-star mergers seem to be ruled out as the dominant r-process source, since their low rates of occurrence would lead to r-process enrichment that is not consistent with observations at very low metallicities. Additionally, the considerable injection of r-process material by a single neutron-star merger leads to a scatter in [r-process/Fe] ratios at later times which is much too large compared to observations.},

Using a new set of stellar models covering a grid of values of helium and metallicity, we find that the best possible estimate of the helium abundance of the bluer branch of the MS is Y = 0.39 {\textpm} 0.02. For the cluster center, we apply new techniques to old observations: we use indices of photometric quality to select a high-quality sample of stars, which we also correct for differential reddening. We then superpose the color-magnitude diagram of the outer field on that of the cluster center, and suggest a connection of the bluer branch of the MS with one of the more prominent among the many sequences in the subgiant region. We also report a group of undoubted cluster members that are well to the red of the lower MS.

abstract = {When the core hydrogen is exhausted during stellar evolution, the central region of a star contracts and the outer envelope expands and cools, giving rise to a red giant. Convection takes place over much of the star's radius. Conservation of angular momentum requires that the cores of these stars rotate faster than their envelopes; indirect evidence supports this. Information about the angular-momentum distribution is inaccessible to direct observations, but it can be extracted from the effect of rotation on oscillation modes that probe the stellar interior. Here we report an increasing rotation rate from the surface of the star to the stellar core in the interiors of red giants, obtained using the rotational frequency splitting of recently detected `mixed modes'. By comparison with theoretical stellar models, we conclude that the core must rotate at least ten times faster than the surface. This observational result confirms the theoretical prediction of a steep gradient in the rotation profile towards the deep stellar interior.},

The former undergo significant depletion of carbon on the red giant branch after they have undergone first dredge-up, whereas the latter do not appear to experience significant depletion. We investigate this in the context that the extra mixing occurs via the thermohaline instability that arises due to the burning of 3He. We present the evolution of [C/Fe], [N/Fe] and 12C/13C for three models: a carbon-normal metal-poor star, and two stars that have accreted material from a 1.5Msolar AGB companion, one having received 0.01Msolar of material and the other having received 0.1Msolar. We find the behaviour of the carbon-normal metal-poor stars is well reproduced by this mechanism. In addition, our models also show that the efficiency of carbon-depletion is significantly reduced in carbon-rich stars. This extra-mixing mechanism is able to reproduce the observed properties of both carbon-normal and carbon-rich stars.},

We have determined electron temperatures, electron densities and ionic abundances using different continuum and line intensity ratios. We derived the He, C and 0 abundances from recombination lines and find that the C/H and 0/H values are very similar to those derived from B stars of the Orion association, and that these nebular values are independent of the temperature structure. We have also derived abundances from collisionally excited lines. These abundances depend on the temperature structure; accurate t2 values have been derived comparing the On recombination lines with the [O III] collision ally excited lines. The gaseous abundances of Mg, Si and Fe show significant depletions, implying that a substantial fraction of these atoms is tied up in dust grains. The derived depletions are similar to those found in warm clouds of the Galactic disc, but are not as large as those found in cold clouds.

We find that (1) the ratio, T N, of the number of clusters, N CL, to parent galaxy stellar mass, M *, rises weakly with M * for early-type galaxies with M * > 1010 M ⊙ when we calculate galaxy masses using a universal stellar initial mass function (IMF) but that the dependence of T N on M * is removed entirely once we correct for the recently uncovered systematic variation of IMF with M *; and (2) for M * < 1010 M ⊙, there is no trend between N CL and M *, the scatter in T N is significantly larger (approaching two orders of magnitude), and there is evidence to support a previous, independent suggestion of two families of galaxies. The behavior of N CL in the lower-mass systems is more difficult to measure because these systems are inherently cluster-poor, but our results may add to previous evidence that large variations in cluster formation and destruction efficiencies are to be found among low-mass galaxies. The average fraction of stellar mass in clusters is {\textasciitilde}0.0014 for M * > 1010 M ⊙ and can be as large as {\textasciitilde}0.02 for less massive galaxies. These are the first results from the S4G sample of galaxies and will be enhanced by the sample of early-type galaxies now being added to S4G and complemented by the study of later-type galaxies within S4G.},

abstract = {The explosion of a carbon-oxygen white dwarf as a Type Ia supernova is known to be sensitive to the manner in which the burning is ignited. Studies of the presupernova evolution suggest asymmetric, off-center ignition, and here we explore its consequences in two- (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) simulations. Compared with centrally ignited models, one-sided ignitions initially burn less and release less energy. For the distributions of ignition points studied, ignition within two hemispheres typically leads to the unbinding of the white dwarf, while ignition within a small fraction of one hemisphere does not. We also examine the spreading of the blast over the surface of the white dwarf that occurs as the first plumes of burning erupt from the star. In particular, our studies test whether the collision of strong compressional waves can trigger a detonation on the far side of the star as has been suggested by Plewa and coworkers. The maximum temperature reached in these collisions is sensitive to how much burning and expansion has already gone on, and to the dimensionality of the calculation. Although detonations are sometimes observed in 2D models, none ever happens in the corresponding 3D calculations. Collisions between the expansion fronts of multiple bubbles also seem, in the usual case, unable to ignite a detonation. ``Gravitationally confined detonation'' is therefore not a robust mechanism for the explosion. Detonation may still be possible in these models, however, either following a pulsation or by spontaneous detonation if the turbulent energy is high enough.},

abstract = {Context. Open clusters are very useful targets for examining possible trends in galactocentric distance and age, especially when young and old open clusters are compared. Aims: We carried out a detailed spectroscopic analysis to derive the chemical composition of seven red giants in the young open cluster NGC 3114. Abundances of C, N, O, Li, Na, Mg, Al, Ca, Si, Ti, Ni, Cr, Y, Zr, La, Ce, and Nd were obtained, as well as the carbon isotopic ratio. Methods: The atmospheric parameters of the studied stars and their chemical abundances were determined using high-resolution optical spectroscopy. We employed the local-thermodynamic-equilibrium model atmospheres of Kurucz and the spectral analysis code MOOG. The abundances of the light elements were derived using the spectral synthesis technique. Results: We found that NGC 3114 has a mean metallicity of [Fe/H] = -0.01 {\textpm} 0.03. The isochrone fit yielded a turn-off mass of 4.2 M⊙. The [N/C] ratio is in good agreement with the models predicted by first dredge-up. We found that two stars, HD 87479 and HD 304864, have high rotational velocities of 15.0 km s-1 and 11.0 km s-1; HD 87526 is a halo star and is not a member of NGC 3114. Conclusions: The carbon and nitrogen abundance in NGC 3114 agree with the field and cluster giants. The oxygen abundance in NGC 3114 is lower compared to the field giants. The [O/Fe] ratio is similar to the giants in young clusters. We detected sodium enrichment in the analyzed cluster giants. As far as the other elements are concerned, their [X/Fe] ratios follow the same trend seen in giants with the same metallicity.

Mass loss has been taken into account with different descriptions for the RGB, AGB and post-AGB phase. On the AGB we considered mass loss with a formula based on dynamical calculations of the atmospheres of Mira-like stars. Our results are consistent with empirical initial-final mass relations. It is shown that hot bottom burning and mass loss are closely connected. The overluminosity as well as the nucleosynthesis of hot bottom burning models can depend sensitively on mass loss. Furthermore, we discuss the influence of mass loss on the internal structure reached at the tip of the AGB, and emphasize that post-AGB timescales will depend strongly on the AGB history, i.e. on the initial mass and the applied mass-loss law.},

abstract = {Understanding massive stars is essential for a variety of branches of astronomy including galaxy and star cluster evolution, nucleosynthesis and supernovae, pulsars, and black holes. It has become evident that massive star evolution is very diverse, being sensitive to metallicity, binarity, rotation, and possibly magnetic fields. Although the problem to obtain a good statistical observational database is alleviated by current large spectroscopic surveys, it remains a challenge to model these diverse paths of massive stars toward their violent end stage. I show that the main sequence stage offers the best opportunity to gauge the relevance of the various possible evolutionary scenarios. This also allows sketching the post-main-sequence evolution of massive stars, for which observations of Wolf-Rayet stars give essential clues. Recent supernova discoveries owing to the current boost in transient searches allow tentative mappings of progenitor models with supernova types, including pair-instability supernovae and gamma-ray bursts.},

abstract = {Context. The literature is rich in analysis and results related to thermally pulsing-asymptotic giant branch (TP-AGB) stars, but the problem of the instabilities that arise and cause the divergence of models during the late stages of their evolution is rarely addressed. Aims: We investigate the physical conditions, causes and consequences of the interruption in the calculations of massive AGB stars in the late thermally-pulsing AGB phase. Methods: We have thoroughly analysed the physical structure of a solar metallicity 8.5 M{\&}sun; star and described the physical conditions at the base of the convective envelope (BCE) just prior to divergence. Results: We find that the local opacity maximum caused by M-shell electrons of Fe-group elements lead to the accumulation of an energy excess, to the departure of thermal equilibrium conditions at the base of the convective envelope and, eventually, to the divergence of the computed models. For the 8.5 M{\&}sun; case we present in this work the divergence occurs when the envelope mass is about 2 M{\&}sun;. The remaining envelope masses range between somewhat less than 1 and more than 2 M{\&}sun; for stars with initial masses between 7 and 10 M{\&}sun; and, therefore, our results are relevant for the evolution and yields of super-AGB stars. If the envelope is ejected as a consequence of the instability we are considering, the occurrence of electron-capture supernovae would be avoided at solar metallicity.},

abstract = {In this paper, we constrain the properties of primordial binary populations in Galactic globular clusters. Using the MOCCA Monte Carlo code for cluster evolution, our simulations cover three decades in present-day total cluster mass. Our results are compared to the observations of Milone et al. using the photometric binary populations as proxies for the true underlying distributions, in order to test the hypothesis that the data are consistent with a universal initial binary fraction near unity and the binary orbital parameter distributions of Kroupa. With the exception of a few possible outliers, we find that the data are to first-order consistent with the universality hypothesis. Specifically, the present-day binary fractions inside the half-mass radius can be reproduced assuming either high initial binary fractions near unity with a dominant soft binary component as in the Kroupa distribution combined with high initial densities (104-106 M⊙ pc-3), or low initial binary fractions ({\~{ }}5-10 per cent) with a dominant hard binary component combined with moderate initial densities near their present-day values (102-103 M⊙ pc-3). This apparent degeneracy can potentially be broken using the binary fractions outside the half-mass radius - only high initial binary fractions with a significant soft component combined with high initial densities can reproduce the observed anticorrelation between the binary fractions outside the half-mass radius and the total cluster mass. We further illustrate using the simulated present-day binary orbital parameter distributions and the technique first introduced in Leigh et al. that the relative fractions of hard and soft binaries can be used to further constrain both the initial cluster density and the initial mass-density relation. Our results favour an initial mass-density relation of the form r_h $\propto$ M_clus^{$\alpha$ } with $\alpha$ < 1/3, corresponding to an initial correlation between cluster mass and density.},

abstract = {NGC 6388 and NGC 6441 are two massive Galactic bulge globular clusters that share many properties, including the presence of an extended horizontal branch (HB), quite unexpected because of their high metal content. In this paper we use Hubble Space Telescope's WFPC2, ACS, and WFC3 images and present a broad multicolor study of their stellar content, covering all main evolutionary branches. The color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) give compelling evidence that both clusters host at least two stellar populations, which manifest themselves in different ways. NGC 6388 has a broadened main sequence (MS), a split sub-giant branch (SGB), and a split red giant branch (RGB) that becomes evident above the HB in our data set; its red HB is also split into two branches. NGC 6441 has a split MS, but only an indication of two SGB populations, while the RGB clearly splits in two from the SGB level upward, and no red HB structure. The multicolor analysis of the CMDs confirms that the He difference between the two main stellar populations in the two clusters must be similar. This is observationally supported by the HB morphology, but also confirmed by the color distribution of the stars in the MS optical band CMDs. However, a MS split becomes evident in NGC 6441 using UV colors, but not in NGC 6388, indicating that the chemical patterns of the different populations are different in the two clusters, with C, N, and O abundance differences likely playing a major role. We also analyze the radial distribution of the two populations. Based on proprietary and archival observations with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by AURA, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555.},

This phenomenon, known as the blue tilt, implies a mass-metallicity relationship among these clusters. In this paper, we show that self-enrichment in GCs can explain several aspects of the blue tilt and discuss predictions of this scenario.},

abstract = {In a companion paper, Seitenzahl et al. have presented a set of three-dimensional delayed detonation models for thermonuclear explosions of near-Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarfs (WDs). Here, we present multidimensional radiative transfer simulations that provide synthetic light curves and spectra for those models. The model sequence explores both changes in the strength of the deflagration phase (which is controlled by the ignition configuration in our models) and the WD central density. In agreement with previous studies, we find that the strength of the deflagration significantly affects the explosion and the observables. Variations in the central density also have an influence on both brightness and colour, but overall it is a secondary parameter in our set of models. In many respects, the models yield a good match to the observed properties of normal Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia): peak brightness, rise/decline time-scales and synthetic spectra are all in reasonable agreement. There are, however, several differences. In particular, the models are systematically too red around maximum light, manifest spectral line velocities that are a little too high and yield I-band light curves that do not match observations. Although some of these discrepancies may simply relate to approximations made in the modelling, some pose real challenges to the models. If viewed as a complete sequence, our models do not reproduce the observed light-curve width-luminosity relation (WLR) of SNe Ia: all our models show rather similar B-band decline rates, irrespective of peak brightness. This suggests that simple variations in the strength of the deflagration phase in Chandrasekhar-mass deflagration-to-detonation models do not readily explain the observed diversity of normal SNe Ia. This may imply that some other parameter within the Chandrasekhar-mass paradigm is key to the WLR, or that a substantial fraction of normal SNe Ia arise from an alternative explosion scenario.},

abstract = {Aims: A proper determination of the abundance gradient in the Milky Way requires the observation of objects at large galactiocentric distances. With this aim, we are exploring the planetary nebula population towards the Galactic anticentre. In this article, the discovery and physico-chemical study of a new planetary nebula towards the anticentre direction, IPHASX J052531.19+281945.1 (PNG 178.1-04.0), is presented. Methods: The planetary nebula was discovered from the IPHAS survey. Long-slit follow-up spectroscopy was carried out to confirm its planetary nebula nature and to calculate its physical and chemical characteristics. Results: The newly discovered planetary nebula turned out to be located at a very large galactocentric distance (DGC = 20.8 {\textpm} 3.8 kpc), larger than any previously known planetary nebula with measured abundances. Its relatively high oxygen abundance (12+log(O/H) = 8.36 {\textpm} 0.03) supports a flattening of the Galactic abundance gradient at large galactocentric distances rather than a linearly decreasing gradient.},

abstract = {A grid of evolutionary sequences of stars in the mass range 1.2-7M⊙, with solar-like initial composition is presented. We focus on this mass range in order to estimate the masses and calculate the CNO surface abundances of a sample of observed red giants. The stellar models are calculated from the zero-age main sequence till the early asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase. Stars of M $\le$ 2.2M⊙ are evolved through the core helium flash. In this work, an approach is adopted that improves the mass determination of an observed sample of 21 RGB and early AGB stars. This approach is based on comparing the observationally derived effective temperatures and absolute magnitudes with the calculated values based on our evolutionary tracks in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. A more reliable determination of the stellar masses is achieved by using evolutionary tracks extended to the range of observation. In addition, the predicted CNO surface abundances are compared to the observationally inferred values in order to show how far standard evolutionary calculation can be used to interpret available observations and to illustrate the role of convective mixing. We find that extra mixing beyond the convective boundary determined by the Schwarzschild criterion is needed to explain the observational oxygen isotopic ratios in low-mass stars. The effect of recent determinations of proton capture reactions and their uncertainties on the 16O/17O and 14N/15N ratios is also shown. It is found that the 14N( p, $\gamma$)15O reaction is important for predicting the 14N/15N ratio in red giants.},

abstract = {The cosmic dark ages ended a few hundred million years after the big bang, when the first stars began to fill the universe with new light. It has generally been argued that these stars formed in isolation and were extremely massive{\textemdash}perhaps 100 times as massive as the Sun. In a recent study, Clark and collaborators showed that this picture requires revision. They demonstrated that the accretion disks that build up around Population III stars are strongly susceptible to fragmentation and that the first stars should therefore form in clusters rather than in isolation. We here use a series of high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations performed with the moving mesh code AREPO to follow up on this proposal and to study the influence of environmental parameters on the level of fragmentation. We model the collapse of five independent minihalos from cosmological initial conditions, through the runaway condensation of their central gas clouds, to the formation of the first protostar, and beyond for a further 1000 years. During this latter accretion phase, we represent the optically thick regions of protostars by sink particles. Gas accumulates rapidly in the circumstellar disk around the first protostar, fragmenting vigorously to produce a small group of protostars. After an initial burst, gravitational instability recurs periodically, forming additional protostars with masses ranging from {\textasciitilde}0.1 to 10 M sun. Although the shape, multiplicity, and normalization of the protostellar mass function depend on the details of the sink-particle algorithm, fragmentation into protostars with diverse masses occurs in all cases, confirming earlier reports of Population III stars forming in clusters. Depending on the efficiency of later accretion and merging, Population III stars may enter the main sequence in clusters and with much more diverse masses than are commonly assumed.},

Being born with masses {\~{ }}1.1 M⊙, hybrid WDs in a binary system may easily approach the Chandrasekhar mass (MCh) by accretion and give rise to a thermonuclear explosion. Here, we investigate an off-centre deflagration in a near-MCh hybrid WD under the assumption that nuclear burning only occurs in carbon-rich material. Performing hydrodynamics simulations of the explosion and detailed nucleosynthesis post-processing calculations, we find that only 0.014 M⊙ of material is ejected while the remainder of the mass stays bound. The ejecta consist predominantly of iron-group elements, O, C, Si and S. We also calculate synthetic observables for our model and find reasonable agreement with the faint Type Iax SN 2008ha. This shows for the first time that deflagrations in near-MCh WDs can in principle explain the observed diversity of Type Iax supernovae. Leaving behind a near-MCh bound remnant opens the possibility for recurrent explosions or a subsequent accretion-induced collapse in faint Type Iax SNe, if further accretion episodes occur. From binary population synthesis calculations, we find the rate of hybrid WDs approaching MCh to be of the order of 1 per cent of the Galactic SN Ia rate.},

abstract = {We perform a stellar evolution simulation of first stars and calculate stellar yields from the first supernovae. The initial masses are taken from 12 to 140 M ⊙ to cover the whole range of core-collapse supernova progenitors, and stellar rotation is included, which results in efficient internal mixing. A weak explosion is assumed in supernova yield calculations, thus only outer distributed matter, which is not affected by the explosive nucleosynthesis, is ejected in the models. We show that the initial mass and the rotation affect the explosion yield. All the weak explosion models have abundances of [C/O] larger than unity. Stellar yields from massive progenitors of >40-60 M ⊙ show enhancement of Mg and Si. Rotating models yield abundant Na and Al, and Ca is synthesized in nonrotating heavy massive models of >80 M ⊙. We fit the stellar yields to the three most iron-deficient stars and constrain the initial parameters of the mother progenitor stars. The abundance pattern in SMSS 0313-6708 is well explained by 50-80 M ⊙ nonrotating models, rotating 30-40 M ⊙ models well fit the abundance of HE 0107-5240, and both nonrotating and rotating 15-40 M ⊙ models explain HE 1327-2326. The presented analysis will be applicable to other carbon-enhanced hyper-metal-poor stars observed in the future. The abundance analyses will give valuable information about the characteristics of the first stars.},

abstract = {Stellar migration in Galactic disks has been the subject of several investigations in the past years. However, its impact on the chemical evolution of the Milky Way still needs to be fully quantified. In this paper, we aim to impose some constraints on the significance of this phenomenon by considering its influence on the chemical evolution of the Milky Way thin disk. We do not investigate the physical mechanisms underlying the migration of stars. Rather, we introduce a simple, heuristic treatment of stellar migration in a detailed chemical evolution model for the thin disk of the Milky Way, which already includes radial gas flows and reproduces several observational constraints for the solar vicinity and the whole Galactic disk. When stellar migration is implemented according to the results of chemo-dynamical simulations by Minchev et al. and finite stellar velocities of 1 km s-1 are taken into account, the high-metallicity tail of the metallicity distribution function of long-lived, thin-disk stars is well reproduced. By exploring the velocity space, we find that the migrating stars must travel with velocities in the range of 0.5{\textendash}2 km s-1 to properly reproduce the high-metallicity tail of the metallicity distribution. We confirm previous findings by other authors that the observed spread in the age{\textendash}metallicity relation of solar neighborhood stars can be explained by the presence of stars that originated at different Galactocentric distances, and we conclude that the chemical properties of stars currently observed in the solar vicinity do suggest that stellar migration is present to some extent.},

abstract = {Knowledge of the progenitors of core-collapse supernovae is a fundamental component in understanding the explosions. The recent progress in finding such stars is reviewed. The minimum initial mass that can produce a supernova (SN) has converged to 8 {\textpm} 1 M from direct detections of red supergiant progenitors of II-P SNe and the most massive white dwarf progenitors, although this value is model dependent. It appears that most type Ibc SNe arise from moderate mass interacting binaries. The highly energetic, broad-lined Ic SNe are likely produced by massive, Wolf-Rayet progenitors. There is some evidence to suggest that the majority of massive stars above 20 M may collapse quietly to black holes and that the explosions remain undetected. The recent discovery of a class of ultrabright type II SNe and the direct detection of some progenitor stars bearing luminous blue variable characteristics suggest some very massive stars do produce highly energetic explosions. The physical mechanism is under debate, and these SNe pose a challenge to stellar evolutionary theory.},

abstract = {We model the evolution of the abundances of light elements in carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars, under the assumption that such stars are formed by mass transfer in a binary system. We have modelled the accretion of material ejected by an asymptotic giant branch star on to the surface of a companion star. We then examine three different scenarios: one in which the material is mixed only by convective processes, one in which thermohaline mixing is present and a third in which both thermohaline mixing and gravitational settling are taken in to account. The results of these runs are compared to light element abundance measurements in CEMP stars (primarily CEMP-s stars, which are rich in s-processes elements and likely to have formed by mass transfer from an AGB star), focusing on the elements Li, F, Na and Mg. None of the elements is able to provide a conclusive picture of the extent of mixing of accreted material. We confirm that lithium can only be preserved if little mixing takes place. The bulk of the sodium observations suggest that accreted material is effectively mixed but there are also several highly Na and Mg-rich objects that can only be explained if the accreted material is unmixed. We suggest that the available sodium data may hint that extra mixing is taking place on the giant branch, though we caution that the data are sparse.},

abstract = {We present the adaptable MUESLI code for investigating dynamics and erosion processes of globular clusters (GCs) in galaxies. MUESLI follows the orbits of individual clusters and applies internal and external dissolution processes to them. Orbit integration is based on the self-consistent field method in combination with a time-transformed leapfrog scheme, allowing us to handle velocity-dependent forces like triaxial dynamical friction. In a first application, the erosion of GC systems (GCSs) in elliptical galaxies is investigated. Observations show that massive ellipticals have rich, radially extended GCSs, while some compact dwarf ellipticals contain no GCs at all. For several representative examples, spanning the full mass scale of observed elliptical galaxies, we quantify the influence of radial anisotropy, galactic density profiles, supermassive black holes and dynamical friction on the GC erosion rate. We find that GC number density profiles are centrally flattened in less than a Hubble time, naturally explaining observed cored GC distributions. The erosion rate depends primarily on a galaxy's mass, half-mass radius and radial anisotropy. The fraction of eroded GCs is nearly 100 per cent in compact, M32-like galaxies and lowest in extended and massive galaxies. Finally, we uncover the existence of a violent tidal-disruption-dominated phase which is important for the rapid build-up of halo stars.},

abstract = {This work presents a large consistent study of molybdenum (Mo) and ruthenium (Ru) abundances in the Milky Way. These two elements are important nucleosynthetic diagnostics. In our sample of 71 Galactic metal-poor field stars, we detect Ru and/or Mo in 52 of these (59 including upper limits). The sample consists of high-resolution, high signal-to-noise spectra covering both dwarfs and giants from [Fe/H] = -0.63 down to -3.16. Thus we provide information on the behaviour of Mo I and Ru I at higher and lower metallicity than is currently known. In this sample we find a wide spread in the Mo and Ru abundances, which is typical of heavy elements. We confirm earlier findings of Mo enhanced stars around [Fe/H] = -1.5 and add {\textasciitilde}15 stars both dwarfs and giants with normal (<0.3 dex) Mo and Ru abundances, as well as more than 15 Mo and Ru enhanced (>0.5 dex) stars to the currently known stellar sample. This indicates that several formation processes, in addition to high entropy winds, can be responsible for the formation of elements like Mo and Ru. We trace the formation processes by comparing Mo and Ru to elements (Sr, Zr, Pd, Ag, Ba, and Eu) with known formation processes. Based on how tight the two elements correlate with each other, we are able to distinguish if they share a common formation process and how important this contribution is to the element abundance. We find clear indications of contributions from several different formation processes, namely the p-process, and the slow (s-), and rapid (r-) neutron-capture processes. From these correlations we find that Mo is a highly convolved element that receives contributions from both the s-process and the p-process and less from the main and weak r-processes, whereas Ru is mainly formed by the weak r-process as is silver. We also compare our absolute elemental stellar abundances to relative isotopic abundances of presolar grains extracted from meteorites. Their isotopic abundances can be directly linked to the formation process (e.g. r-only isotopes) providing a unique comparison between observationally derived abundances and the nuclear formation process. The comparison to abundances in presolar grains shows that the r-/s-process ratios from the presolar grains match the total elemental chemical composition derived from metal-poor halo stars with [Fe/H] around -1.5 to -1.1 dex. This indicates that both grains and stars around and above [Fe/H] = -1.5 are equally (well) mixed and therefore do not support a heterogeneous presolar nebula. An inhomogeneous interstellar medium (ISM) should only be expected at lower metallicities. Our data, combined with the abundance ratios of presolar grains, could indicate that the AGB yields are less efficiently mixed into stars than into presolar grains. Finally, we detect traces of s-process material at [Fe/H] = -1.5, indicating that this process is at work at this and probably at even lower metallicity.},

abstract = {Open clusters offer us the means to study stellar properties in samples with well-defined ages and initial chemical composition. Here we present a survey of projected rotational velocities for a large sample of mainly B-type stars in young clusters to study the time evolution of the rotational properties of massive stars. The survey is based on moderate-resolution spectra made with the WIYN 3.5 m and CTIO 4 m telescopes and Hydra multi-object spectrographs, and the target stars are members of 19 young open clusters with an age range of approximately 6-73 Myr. We made fits of the observed lines He I $\lambda$$\lambda$4026, 4387, 4471, and Mg II $\lambda$4481, using model theoretical profiles to find projected rotational velocities for a total of 496 OB stars. We find that there are fewer slow rotators among the cluster B-type stars relative to nearby B stars in the field. We present evidence consistent with the idea that the more massive B stars (M>9 Msolar) spin down during their main-sequence phase. However, we also find that the rotational velocity distribution appears to show an increase in the numbers of rapid rotators among clusters with ages of 10 Myr and higher. These rapid rotators appear to be distributed between the zero age and terminal age main-sequence locations in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, and thus only a minority of them can be explained as the result of a spin-up at the terminal age main sequence due to core contraction. We suggest instead that some of these rapid rotators may have been spun up through mass transfer in close binary systems.},

abstract = {We explore the detailed and broad properties of carbon burning in Super Asymptotic Giant Branch (SAGB) stars with 2755 MESA stellar evolution models. The location of first carbon ignition, quenching location of the carbon-burning flames and flashes, angular frequency of the carbon core, and carbon core mass are studied as a function of the zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) mass, initial rotation rate, and mixing parameters such as convective overshoot, semiconvection, thermohaline, and angular momentum transport. In general terms, we find that these properties of carbon burning in SAGB models are not a strong function of the initial rotation profile, but are a sensitive function of the overshoot parameter. We quasi-analytically derive an approximate ignition density, $\rho$ign $\approx$ 2.1 {\texttimes} 106 g cm-3, to predict the location of first carbon ignition in models that ignite carbon off-center. We also find that overshoot moves the ZAMS mass boundaries where off-center carbon ignition occurs at a nearly uniform rate of $\Delta$MZAMS/$\Delta$fov $\approx$ 1.6 {M}{\.{o}} . For zero overshoot, fov = 0.0, our models in the ZAMS mass range $\approx$8.9{\textendash}11 {M}{\.{o}} show off-center carbon ignition. For canonical amounts of overshooting, fov = 0.016, the off-center carbon ignition range shifts to $\approx$7.2{\textendash}8.8 {M}{\.{o}} . Only systems with fov $\ge$ 0.01 and ZAMS mass $\approx$7.2{\textendash}8.0 {M}{\.{o}} show carbon burning is quenched a significant distance from the center. These results suggest a careful assessment of overshoot modeling approximations on claims that carbon burning quenches an appreciable distance from the center of the carbon core.},

It is shown that the key problem is the detailed treatment of the radiation transport in an inhomogeneous and non-isotropic medium. We use a Monte Carlo technique, a proven means to handle complex radiation transport situations, to create photoionization models which are free of approximations concerning the radiative transfer. The code is tested for 1D homogeneous cases against the results from established photoionization codes, reaffirming its applicability to highly structured and non-symmetric nebulae.},

Shell flashes at low core masses do not liberate enough neutrons per flash to build up solar abundances, while flashes at high core masses liberate the neutrons too rapidly. Classical s-process branches appear to be saturated by neutron capture and many r-process elements are produced. The resulting isotope ratios would be distinctly nonsolar.},

abstract = {We investigate the formation of carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars via the scenario of mass transfer from a carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch primary to a low-mass companion in a binary system. We explore the extent to which material accreted from a companion star mixes with that of the recipient, focusing on the effects of thermohaline mixing and gravitational settling. We have created a new set of asymptotic giant branch models to determine what the composition of material being accreted in these systems will be. We then model a range of CEMP systems by evolving a grid of models of low-mass stars, varying the amount of material accreted by the star (to mimic systems with different separations), and also the composition of the accreted material (to mimic accretion from primaries of different mass). We find that with thermohaline mixing alone, the accreted material can mix with 16-88 per cent of the pristine stellar material of the accretor, depending on the mass accreted and the composition of the material. If we include the effects of gravitational settling, we find that thermohaline mixing can be inhibited and, in the case that only a small quantity of material is accreted, can be suppressed almost completely.},

abstract = {We report the detection of asymmetry in the transit light curves of the 110 day period companion to KOI-368, a rapidly rotating A-dwarf. The significant distortion in the transit light curve is attributed to spin-orbit misalignment between the transiting companion and the gravity darkened host star. Our analysis was based on 11 long cadence and 2 short cadence transits of KOI-368.01 from the Kepler mission, as well as stellar parameters determined from our follow-up spectroscopic observation. We measured the true obliquity between the orbit normal and the stellar rotation axis to be 69_{-10}^{+9\,\circ }. We also find a secondary eclipse event with depth 29 {\textpm} 3 ppm at phase 0.59, from which the temperature of the companion is constrained to 3060 {\textpm} 50 K, indicating that KOI-368.01 is a late M-dwarf. The eccentricity is also calculated from the eclipse to be 0.1429 {\textpm} 0.0007. The long period, high obliquity, and low eccentricity of KOI-368.01 allow us to limit a number of proposed theories for the misalignment of binary systems.},

abstract = {The globular cluster M22 is particularly interesting for an abundance study because Hesser et al. (1977) have presented evidence that the metal abundance of individual stars is not uniform throughout the cluster. A second reason for observing M22 is the fact that its red giants are rather cool for its metallicity. In connection with the present investigation spectra were obtained of six stars in M22. The six stars selected together with their magnitudes and solar indices are listed in a table, while a journal of the spectroscopic data is presented in another table. It is found that the ratios of several elements relative to iron is not solar. The metal abundances depend sensitively on effective temperature which can best be determined from the color indices. Effective temperatures are derived on the basis of both B-V and the V-K colors corrected for reddening.},

abstract = {A 10 solar mass model of Population I composition is evolved from the hydrogen-burning main sequence onto the early 'super'-asymptotic giant branch (ESAGB), where hydrogen does not burn, the dominant source of surface luminosity is shell helium burning, and carbon burning in the helium-exhausted core converts all of the initial C-12 and Ne-22 and some of the O-16 in this core into isotopes of oxygen, neon, sodium, magnesium, and other heavy elements. The entire ESAGB phase lasts approximately 4.6 x 104 yr, and helium burning is the primary source of surface luminosity for all but approximately 3000 yr. The carbon-burning phase lasts approximately 2 x 104 yr. In comparison, the main-sequence phase lasts approximately 2 x 107 yr, and the core helium-burning phase lasts approximately 4 x 106 yr. At the end of the core carbon-burning phase, dredge-up decreases the mass of the hydrogen-exhausted core from approximately 2.46 solar mass to approximately 1.315 solar mass. During the dredge-up episode, in addition to products of complete hydrogen burning, products of incomplete helium burning are mixed into the hydrogen-rich convective enevelope. At the end of the second dredge-up phase, the model has an electron-degenerate carbon-exhausted core of mass approximately 1.285 solar mass. Between the carbon-exhausted core and the hydrogen-rich convective envelope are three layers which are each of mass approximately 0.01 solar mass and which contain (1) C-12 and O-16 at comparable abundances by mass; (2) C-12 and He-4 at comparable abundances by mass; and (3) mostly He-4 with some C-12. The abundances by mass of the main constituents of the carbon-exhausted core vary signifcantly through the core. At the center, abundances of mass are X(O-16) approximately 0.80, X(Ne-20) approximately 0.11, X(Na-22) approximately 0.03, X(Mg-24) approximatelly 0.0075, and X(Mg-26) approximately 0.01, whereas, near the edge of the core, X(O-16) approximately 0.19, X(Ne-20) approximately 0.50, X(Na-23) approximately 0.04, and X(Mg-24) approximately 0.27. The abundance of Na-23 is large enough that, if the mass of the SAGB core can grow to approximately 1.37 solar mass, core collapse into a neutron star will be initiated by electron capture on Na-23 rather than on Mg-24.},

abstract = {We present the results of s-process nucleosynthesis calculations for asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars of different metallicities and different initial stellar masses (1.5 and 3 Msolar), and we present comparisons of them with observational constraints from high-resolution spectroscopy of evolved stars over a wide metallicity range. The computations were based on previously published stellar evolutionary models that account for the third dredge-up phenomenon occurring late on the AGB. Neutron production is driven by the 13C($\alpha$,n)16O reaction during the interpulse periods in a tiny layer in radiative equilibrium at the top of the He- and C-rich shell. The neutron source 13C is manufactured locally by proton captures on the abundant 12C; a few protons are assumed to penetrate from the convective envelope into the radiative layer at any third dredge-up episode, when a chemical discontinuity is established between the convective envelope and the He- and C-rich zones. A weaker neutron release is also guaranteed by the marginal activation of the reaction 22Ne($\alpha$,n)25Mg during the convective thermal pulses. Owing to the lack of a consistent model for 13C formation, the abundance of 13C burnt per cycle is allowed to vary as a free parameter over a wide interval (a factor of 50). The s-enriched material is subsequently mixed with the envelope by the third dredge-up, and the envelope composition is computed after each thermal pulse. We follow the changes in the photospheric abundance of the Ba-peak elements (heavy s [hs]) and that of the Zr-peak ones (light s [ls]), whose logarithmic ratio [hs/ls] has often been adopted as an indicator of the s-process efficiency (e.g., of the neutron exposure). Our model predictions for this parameter show a complex trend versus metallicity. Especially noteworthy is the prediction that the flow along the s-path at low metallicities drains the Zr and Ba peaks and builds an excess at the doubly magic 208Pb, which is at the termination of the s-path. We then discuss the effects on the models of variations in the crucial parameters of the 13C pocket, finding that they are not critical for interpreting the results. The theoretical predictions are compared with published abundances of s-elements for AGB giants of classes MS, S, SC, post-AGB supergiants, and for various classes of binary stars, which supposedly derive their composition by mass transfer from an AGB companion. This is done for objects belonging both to the Galactic disk and to the halo. The observations in general confirm the complex dependence of neutron captures on metallicity. They suggest that a moderate spread exists in the abundance of 13C that is burnt in different stars. Although additional observations are needed, it seems that a good understanding has been achieved of s-process operation in AGB stars. Finally, the detailed abundance distribution including the light elements (CNO) of a few s-enriched stars at different metallicities are examined and satisfactorily reproduced by model envelope compositions.},

abstract = {We analysed high-resolution UVES spectra of six stars belonging to the subgiant branch of $\omega$ Centauri, and derived abundance ratios of 19 chemical elements (namely Al, Ba, C, Ca, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, La, Mg, Mn, N, Na, Ni, Sc, Si, Sr, Ti, and Y). A comparison with previous abundance determinations for red giants provided remarkable agreement and allowed us to identify the sub-populations to which our targets belong. We found that three targets belong to a low-metallicity population at [Fe/H] ≃ -2.0 dex, [$\alpha$/Fe] ≃ +0.4 dex and [s/Fe] ≃ 0 dex. Stars with similar characteristics were found in small amounts by past surveys of red giants. We discuss the possibility that they belong to a separate sub-population that we name VMP (very metal-poor, at most 5% of the total cluster population), which - in the self-enrichment hypothesis - is the best-candidate first stellar generation in $\omega$ Cen. Two of the remaining targets belong to the dominant metal-poor population (MP) at [Fe/H] ≃ -1.7 dex, and the last one to the metal-intermediate (MInt) one at [Fe/H] ≃ -1.2 dex. The existence of the newly defined VMP population could help to understand some puzzling results based on low-resolution spectroscopy for age differences determinations, because the metallicity resolution of these studies was probably not enough to detect the VMP population. The VMP could also correspond to some of the additional substructures of the subgiant-branch region found in the latest HST photometry. After trying to correlate chemical abundances with substructures in the subgiant branch of $\omega$ Cen, we found that the age difference between the VMP and MP populations should be small (0 {\textpm} 2 Gyr), while the difference between the MP and MInt populations could be slightly larger (2 {\textpm} 2 Gyr).

abstract = {Monte Carlo techniques based on indivisible energy packets are described for computing light curves and spectra for 3-D supernovae. The radiative transfer is time-dependent and includes all effects of O(v/c). Monte Carlo quantization is achieved by discretizing the initial distribution of 56Ni into N radioactive pellets. Each pellet decays with the emission of a single energy packet comprising $\gamma$-ray photons representing one line from either the 56Ni or the 56Co decay spectrum. Subsequently, these energy packets propagate through the homologously-expanding ejecta with appropriate changes in the nature of their contained energy as they undergo Compton scatterings and pure absorptions. The 3-D code is tested by applying it to a spherically-symmetric SN in which the transfer of optical radiation is treated with a grey absorption coefficient. This 1-D problem is separately solved using Castor's co-moving frame moment equations. Satisfactory agreement is obtained. The Monte Carlo code is a platform onto which more advanced treatments of the interactions of matter and radiation can be added. Some of these have already been developed and tested in previous papers and are summarized here.},

The spectral similarities are sufficiently similar to those of solid MgS that MgS is proposed to be the band carrier. This is interpreted as the first direct evidence that chemical surface reactions occur on dust grains in circumstellar environments.

These new yields, that present a significant dependence on metallicity, are then compared to those of other available sets (Renzini {\&} Voli \cite{Re81}; van de Hoek {\&} Groenewegen \cite{va97}). The resulting differences are explained in terms of different model assumptions - i.e. treatment of convective boundaries, mass loss, dredge-up, hot-bottom burning - and further discussed on the basis of important empirical constraints which should be reproduced by theory - i.e. the initial-final mass relation, white dwarf mass distribution, carbon star luminosity function, and chemical abundances of planetary nebulae. We show that present models are able to reproduce such constraints in a satisfactory way.},

To this aim, we compare Spitzer observations of LMC stars with the theoretical tracks of AGB models, calculated with two of the most popular evolution codes, that are known to differ in particular for the treatment of convection. Although the physical evolution of the two models are significantly different, the properties of dust formed in their winds are surprisingly similar, as is their position in the colour-colour and colour-magnitude diagrams obtained with the Spitzer bands. This model-independent result allows us to select a well-defined region in the ([3.6]-[4.5], [5.8]-[8.0]) plane, populated by AGB stars experiencing hot bottom burning, the progeny of stars with mass M {\~{ }} 5.5 M⊙. This result opens up an important test of the strength hot bottom burning using detailed near-IR (H and K bands) spectroscopic analysis of the oxygen-rich, high-luminosity candidates found in the well-defined region of the colour-colour plane. This test is possible because the two stellar evolution codes we use predict very different results for the surface chemistry, and the C/O ratio in particular, owing to their treatment of convection in the envelope and of convective boundaries during third dredge-up. The differences in surface chemistry are most apparent when the model stars reach the phase with the largest infrared emission.},

abstract = {Context: Thermally pulsating asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars are the main producers of slow neutron capture (s-) process elements, but there are still large uncertainties associated with the formation of the main neutron source, 13C, and with the physics of these stars in general. Observations of s-process element enhancements in stars can be used as constraints on theoretical models. Aims: For the first time we have applied stellar population synthesis to the problem of s-process nucleosynthesis in AGB stars, in order to derive constraints on free parameters describing the physics behind the third dredge-up and the properties of the neutron source. Methods: We utilize a rapid evolution and nucleosynthesis code to synthesize different populations of s-enhanced stars, and compare them to their observational counterparts to find out which values of the free parameters in the code produce synthetic populations that fit the observed populations best. These free parameters are the amount of third dredge-up, the minimum core mass for third dredge-up, the effectiveness of 13C as a source of neutrons, and the size in mass of the 13C pocket. Results: We find that galactic disk objects are reproduced by a spread of a factor of two in the effectiveness of the 13C neutron source. Lower metallicity objects can be reproduced only by lowering the average value of the effectiveness of the 13C neutron source needed for the galactic disk objects by at least a factor of 3. Using observations of s-process elements in post-AGB stars as constraints we find that dredge-up has to start at a lower core mass than predicted by current theoretical models, that it has to be substantial ($\lambda$⪆ 0.2) in stars with mass M ⪉ 1.5 M⊙, and that the mass of the 13C pocket must be about 1/40 that of the intershell region.

abstract = {Primordial or big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) is one of the three strong pieces of evidence for the big bang model together with the expansion of the universe and cosmic microwave background radiation. In this study, we improve the standard BBN calculations taking into account new nuclear physics analyses and enlarge the nuclear network up to sodium. This is, in particular, important to evaluate the primitive value of CNO mass fraction that could affect Population III stellar evolution. For the first time we list the complete network of more than 400 reactions with references to the origin of the rates, including $\approx$270 reaction rates calculated using the TALYS code. Together with the cosmological light elements, we calculate the primordial beryllium, boron, carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen nuclei. We performed a sensitivity study to identify the important reactions for CNO, 9Be, and boron nucleosynthesis. We re-evaluated those important reaction rates using experimental data and/or theoretical evaluations. The results are compared with precedent calculations: a primordial beryllium abundance increase by a factor of four compared to its previous evaluation, but we note a stability for B/H and for the CNO/H abundance ratio that remains close to its previous value of 0.7 {\texttimes} 10-15. On the other hand, the extension of the nuclear network has not changed the 7Li value, so its abundance is still 3-4 times greater than its observed spectroscopic value.},

abstract = {Context: We investigate the hydrodynamics of the core helium flash close to its peak. Past research concerned with the dynamics of this event is inconclusive. However, the most recent multidimensional hydrodynamic studies suggest a quiescent behavior and seem to rule out an explosive scenario. Aims: Depending on initial conditions, turbulence models, grid resolution, and dimensionality of the simulation, previous work indicated that the core helium flash could lead either to the disruption of a low-mass star or to a quiescent quasi-hydrostatic evolution. We attempt to clarify this issue by simulating the evolution with advanced numerical methods and detailed microphysics. Methods: Assuming spherical or axial symmetry, we simulate the evolution of the helium core of a 1.25{\textasciitilde}M⊙ star with a metallicity Z=0.02 during the core helium flash at its peak with a grid-based hydrodynamical code. Results: We find that the core helium flash neither rips the star apart, nor significantly alters its structure, since convection plays a crucial role in keeping the star in hydrostatic equilibrium. In addition, our simulations indicate the presence of overshooting, which implies new predictions concerning mixing of chemical species in red giants.},

abstract = {In the classical theory black holes can only absorb and not emit particles. However it is shown that quantum mechanical effects cause black holes to create and emit particles as if they were hot bodies with temperature{hkappa }/{2$\pi$ k} $\approx$ 10^{ - 6} left( {{M_ odot }/M} right){}^ circ K where $\kappa$ is the surface gravity of the black hole. This thermal emission leads to a slow decrease in the mass of the black hole and to its eventual disappearance: any primordial black hole of mass less than about 1015 g would have evaporated by now. Although these quantum effects violate the classical law that the area of the event horizon of a black hole cannot decrease, there remains a Generalized Second Law: S+1/4 A never decreases where S is the entropy of matter outside black holes and A is the sum of the surface areas of the event horizons. This shows that gravitational collapse converts the baryons and leptons in the collapsing body into entropy. It is tempting to speculate that this might be the reason why the Universe contains so much entropy per baryon.},

abstract = {Most Milky Way globular clusters (GCs) exhibit measurable flattening, even if on a very low level. Both cluster rotation and tidal fields are thought to cause this flattening. Nevertheless, rotation has only been confirmed in a handful of GCs, based mostly on individual radial velocities at large radii. We are conducting a survey of the central kinematics of Galactic GCs using the new Integral Field Unit instrument VIRUS-W. We detect rotation in all 11 GCs that we have observed so far, rendering it likely that a large majority of the Milky Way GCs rotate. We use published catalogs of GCs to derive central ellipticities and position angles. We show that in all cases where the central ellipticity permits an accurate measurement of the position angle, those angles are in excellent agreement with the kinematic position angles that we derive from the VIRUS-W velocity fields. We find an unexpected tight correlation between central rotation and outer ellipticity, indicating that rotation drives flattening for the objects in our sample. We also find a tight correlation between central rotation and published values for the central velocity dispersion, most likely due to rotation impacting the old dispersion measurements. This Letter includes data taken at The McDonald Observatory of The University of Texas at Austin.},

Lithium lines were detected in a number of halo dwarfs and were identified as Li-7 displaying a 23-50 mA spectrum. The abundances were uniform for all the old dwarfs, 1/10 that of population I dwarfs. The origin of the Li-7 is discussed, along with depletion mechanisms such as mass loss and destruction in supernovae. It is concluded that the population II dwarfs have an abundance representative of the pregalactic abundance, 5.2/10 billion. This implies a low baryonic density for the universe, even considering errors in the abundance calculations. The conformity with deuterium ratios is further supported for the Big Bang theory, as well as arguments for an open universe.},

abstract = {We have performed multivariate statistical analyses of photometric and chemical abundance parameters of three large samples of stars in the globular cluster $\omega$ Centauri. The statistical analysis of a sample of 735 stars based on seven chemical abundances with the method of Maximum Parsimony (cladistics) yields the most promising results: seven groups are found, distributed along three branches with distinct chemical, spatial and kinematical properties. A progressive chemical evolution can be traced from one group to the next, but also within groups, suggestive of an inhomogeneous chemical enrichment of the initial interstellar matter. The adjustment of stellar evolution models shows that the groups with metallicities [Fe/H] > -1.5 are Helium enriched, thus presumably of second generation. The spatial concentration of the groups increases with chemical evolution, except for two groups, which stand out in their other properties as well. The amplitude of rotation decreases with chemical evolution, except for two of the three metal-rich groups, which rotate fastest, as predicted by recent hydrodynamical simulations. The properties of the groups are interpreted in terms of star formation in gas clouds of different origins. In conclusion, our multivariate analysis has shown that metallicity alone cannot segregate the different populations of $\omega$ Centauri.},

abstract = {The era of detailed asteroseismic analyses opened by space missions such as CoRoT and Kepler has highlighted the need for stellar models devoid of numerical inaccuracies, in order to be able to diagnose which physical aspects are being ignored or poorly treated in standard stellar modeling. We tackle here the important problem of fixing convective zone boundaries in the frame of the local mixing length theory. First we show that the only correct way to locate a convective zone boundary is to find, at each iteration step, through interpolations or extrapolations from points within the convective zone, the mass where the radiative luminosity is equal to the total luminosity. We then discuss two misuses of the boundary condition and the ways they affect stellar modeling and stellar evolution. The first consists in applying the neutrality condition for convective instability on the radiative side of the convective boundary. The second way of misusing the boundary condition comes from the process of fixing the convective boundary through the search for a change of sign of a possibly discontinuous function. We show that these misuses can lead to completely wrong estimates of convective core sizes with important consequences for the following evolutionary phases. We point out the advantages of using a double mesh point at each convective zone boundary. The specific problem of a convective shell is discussed and some remarks concerning overshooting are given.},

abstract = {Context. In the complex picture of multiple stellar populations in globular clusters (GCs), a special role is played by NGC 5139 ($\omega$ Centauri). At variance with the majority of GCs, $\omega$ Cen exhibits significant star-to-star variations in metallicity and in relative neutron-capture element abundance ratios with respect to Fe, along with split evolutionary sequences as revealed from colour-magnitude diagrams. Combining information from photometry and spectroscopy, several studies suggested that an age spread of several Gyr has to be invoked to explain (at least partially) some of the observed features. However, a comprehensive understanding of the formation, evolution and chemical enrichment processes is still not at hand. Aims: Relatively metal-rich $\omega$ Cen stars display neutron-capture abundance distributions dominated by contributions from the s-process, but it is not clear what roles have been played by the so-called main and weaks-process components in generating these abundances. To gain better insight into this question we derived lead (Pb) abundances for several $\omega$ Cen cluster members, because this element can only be produced by the mains-process. Methods: We analysed high-resolution UVES@VLT spectra of a sample of twelve red-giant branch stars, deriving abundances of Pb and also of Y, Zr, La, Ce, Eu, and the C+N+O sum. Spectral synthesis was applied to all features, taking into account isotopic shifts and/or hyperfine structure as needed. Results: We measured for the first time the Pb content in $\omega$ Cen, discovering a clear hint for a Pb production occurring at [Fe/H] > -1.7 dex. Our data suggest that the role of the weak component in the production of s-process elements is negligible. Moreover, evidence gathered from the abundances of other elements indicates that the main component occurring in this GC is peculiar and shifted towards higher mass polluters than the standard one.

abstract = {We present barium, carbon, and silicon isotopic compositions of 38 acid-cleaned presolar SiC grains from Murchison. Comparison with previous data shows that acid washing is highly effective in removing barium contamination. Strong depletions in $\delta$(138Ba/136Ba) values are found, down to {\textendash}400{\textperthousand}, which can only be modeled with a flatter 13C profile within the 13C pocket than is normally used. The dependence of $\delta$(138Ba/136Ba) predictions on the distribution of 13C within the pocket in asymptotic giant branch (AGB) models allows us to probe the 13C profile within the 13C pocket and the pocket mass in AGB stars. In addition, we provide constraints on the 22Ne($\alpha$, n)25Mg rate in the stellar temperature regime relevant to AGB stars, based on $\delta$(134Ba/136Ba) values of mainstream grains. We found two nominally mainstream grains with strongly negative $\delta$(134Ba/136Ba) values that cannot be explained by any of the current AGB model calculations. Instead, such negative values are consistent with the intermediate neutron capture process (i process), which is activated by the very late thermal pulse during the post-AGB phase and characterized by a neutron density much higher than the s process. These two grains may have condensed around post-AGB stars. Finally, we report abundances of two p-process isotopes, 130Ba and 132Ba, in single SiC grains. These isotopes are destroyed in the s process in AGB stars. By comparing their abundances with respect to that of 135Ba, we conclude that there is no measurable decay of 135Cs (t 1/2 = 2.3 Ma) to 135Ba in individual SiC grains, indicating condensation of barium, but not cesium into SiC grains before 135Cs decayed.},

abstract = {We have analyzed oscillations of the red giant star HD 186355 observed by the NASA Kepler satellite. The data consist of the first five quarters of science operations of Kepler, which cover about 13 months. The high-precision time-series data allow us to accurately extract the oscillation frequencies from the power spectrum. We find that the frequency of the maximum oscillation power, $\nu$max, and the mean large frequency separation, $\Delta$$\nu$, are around 106 and 9.4 $\mu$Hz, respectively. A regular pattern of radial and non-radial oscillation modes is identified by stacking the power spectra in an echelle diagram. We use the scaling relations of $\Delta$$\nu$ and $\nu$max to estimate the preliminary asteroseismic mass, which is confirmed with the modeling result (M = 1.45 {\textpm} 0.05 M ⊙) using the Yale Rotating stellar Evolution Code (YREC7). In addition, we constrain the effective temperature, luminosity, and radius from comparisons between observational constraints and models. A number of mixed l = 1 modes are also detected and taken into account in our model comparisons. We find a mean observational period spacing for these mixed modes of about 58 s, suggesting that this red giant branch star is in the shell hydrogen-burning phase.},

abstract = {We revisit previous suggestions that the heating provided by the winds of dying low-mass stars plays an important role in preventing star formation in quiescent galaxies. At the end of their asymptotic giant branch phase, intermediate and low-mass stars eject their envelopes rapidly in a super-wind phase, usually giving rise to planetary nebulae. In spheroidal galaxies with high stellar velocity dispersions, the interaction of these ejected envelopes with the ambient diffuse gas can lead to significant, isotropic and steady-state heating that scales as \dot{M}*$\sigma$*2. We show that cooling of the central regions of the hot diffuse halo gas can be delayed for a Hubble time for halos more massive than ∼ {{10}12.5} {{M}{\.{o}} } at 0\lt z\lt 2, although stellar heating alone is unlikely to forestall cooling in the most massive clusters at z = 0. This mechanism provides a natural explanation for the strong trend of galaxy quiescence with stellar surface density and velocity dispersion. In addition, since the ejected material will thermalize to kT ∼ $\sigma$ *2, this mechanism provides an explanation for the observed similarity between the central temperature of the hot diffuse gas and $\sigma$ *2, a result that is not trivial in light of the short inferred cooling times of the hot gas. The main uncertainty in this analysis is the ultimate fate of the stellar ejecta. Preventing accumulation of the ejecta in the central regions may require energy input from another source, such as Type Ia supernovae. Detailed simulations of the interaction of the stellar wind with the ambient gas are required to better quantify the net effect of AGB heating.},

abstract = {The interpretation of supernova (SN) spectra is essential for deriving SN ejecta properties such as density and composition, which in turn can tell us about their progenitors and the explosion mechanism. A very large number of atomic processes are important for spectrum formation. Several tools for calculating SN spectra exist, but they mainly focus on the very early or late epochs. The intermediate phase, which requires a non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) treatment of radiation transport has rarely been studied. In this paper, we present a new SN radiation transport code, NERO, which can look at those epochs. All the atomic processes are treated in full NLTE, under a steady-state assumption. This is a valid approach between roughly 50 and 500 days after the explosion depending on SN type. This covers the post-maximum photospheric and the early and the intermediate nebular phase. As a test, we compare NERO to the radiation transport code of Jerkstrand, Fransson {\&} Kozma and to the nebular code of Mazzali et al. All three codes have been developed independently and a comparison provides a valuable opportunity to investigate their reliability. Currently, NERO is one-dimensional and can be used for predicting spectra of synthetic explosion models or for deriving SN properties by spectral modelling. To demonstrate this, we study the spectra of the 'normal' Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) 2005cf between 50 and 350 days after the explosion and identify most of the common SN Ia line features at post-maximum epochs.},

We demonstrate that the emerging technology of Augmented Reality can already be used and implemented without expert knowledge using currently available apps. Our experiments highlight the potential of Augmented Reality to improve the communication of scientific results in the field of astrophysics. We also present feedback gathered from the Australian astrophysics community that reveals evidence of some interest in this technology by astronomers who experimented with Augmented Posters. In addition, we discuss possible future trends for Augmented Reality applications in astrophysics, and explore the current limitations associated with the technology.

abstract = {Large star-to-star variations of the abundances of proton-capture elements, such as Na and O, in globular clusters (GCs) are interpreted as the effect of internal pollution resulting from the presence of multiple stellar populations. To better constrain this scenario, we investigate the abundance distribution of the heavy element rubidium (Rb) in NGC 6752, NGC 1904, and NGC 104 (47 Tuc). Combining the results from our sample with those in the literature, we found that Rb exhibits no star-to-star variations, regardless of cluster metallicity, with the possible intriguing, although very uncertain, exception of the metal-rich bulge cluster NGC 6388. If no star-to-star variations can be confirmed for all GCs, this finding implies that the stellar source of the proton-capture element variations must not have produced significant amounts of Rb. This element is observed to be enhanced at extremely high levels in intermediate-mass asymptotic giant branch (IM-AGB) stars in the Magellanic Clouds (i.e., at a metallicity similar to 47 Tuc and NGC 6388). This fact may present a challenge to this popular candidate polluter, unless the mass range of the observed IM-AGB stars does not participate in the formation of the second-generation stars in GCs. A number of possible solutions are available to resolve this conundrum, including the fact that the Magellanic Cloud observations are very uncertain and may need to be revised. The fast rotating massive stars scenario would not face this potential problem as the slow mechanical winds of these stars during their main-sequence phase do not carry any Rb enhancements; however, these candidates face even bigger issues such as the production of Li and the close overlap with core-collapse supernova timescales. Observations of Sr, Rb, and Zr in metal-rich clusters such as NGC 6388 and NGC 6441 are sorely needed to clarify the situation. Based on observations taken with ESO telescopes under program 085.D-0205(A).},

In this Letter, we present Na, O, and Li abundances in a large sample of dwarf stars in the metal-rich GC 47 Tucanae. We found a clear Na-O anticorrelation, in good agreement with what obtained for giant members by Carretta et al. While lithium and oxygen abundances appear to be positively correlated with each other, there is a large scatter, well exceeding observational errors, and no anticorrelation with sodium. These findings suggest that Li depletion, due to mechanisms internal to the stars (which are cooler and more metal-rich than those on the Spite plateau), combines with the usual pollution scenario responsible for the Na-O anticorrelation.},

Special attention has been payed to carbon burning in conditions of partial degeneracy as well as to the subsequent thermally pulsing Super-AGB phase. The latter develops in a fashion very similar to that of a solar metallicity 9 M⊙ star, as a consequence of the significant enrichment in metals of the stellar envelope that ensues due to the so-called third dredge-up episode. The abundances in mass of the main isotopes in the final ONe core resulting from the evolution are X(16O)$\approx$ 0.59, X(20Ne)$\approx$ 0.28 and X(24Mg)$\approx$ 0.05.

abstract = {We investigate the viability of a model in which the chemical anomalies among globular cluster stars are due to accretion of gas on to the protostellar discs of low-mass stars. This model has been suggested as a way to reduce the large initial cluster masses required by other models for the formation of multiple stellar generations. We numerically follow the evolution of the accreting stars, and we show that the structure of the seed star does not remain fully convective for the whole duration of the accretion phase. Stellar populations showing discrete abundances of helium in the core, that seem to be present in some clusters, might be formed with this mechanism only if accretion occurs before the core of the stars become radiative (within 2-3 Myr) or if a thermohaline instability is triggered, to achieve full mixing after the accretion phase ends. We also show that the lithium abundances in accreted structures may vary by orders of magnitude in equal masses obtained by accreting different masses. In addition, the same thermohaline mixing which could provide a homogeneous helium distribution down to the stellar centre, would destroy any lithium surviving in the envelope, so that both helium homogeneity and lithium survival require that the accretion phase be limited to the first couple of million years of the cluster evolution. Such a short accretion phase strongly reduces the amount of processed matter available, and reintroduces the requirement of an extremely large initial mass for the protocluster.},

abstract = {Context. Carbon and oxygen abundances in stars are important in many fields of astrophysics including nucleosynthesis, stellar structure, evolution of galaxies, and formation of planetary systems. Still, our knowledge of the abundances of these elements in different stellar populations is uncertain because of difficulties in observing and analyzing atomic and molecular lines of C and O. Aims: Abundances of C, O, and Fe are determined for F and G main-sequence stars in the solar neighborhood with metallicities in the range -1.6 < [Fe/H] < +0.4 in order to study trends and possible systematic differences in the C/Fe, O/Fe, and C/O ratios for thin- and thick-disk stars as well as high- and low-alpha halo stars. In addition, we investigate if there is any connection between C and O abundances in stellar atmospheres and the occurrence of planets. Methods: Carbon abundances are determined from the $\lambda$$\lambda$ 5052,5380 C i lines and oxygen abundances from the $\lambda$7774 O i triplet and the forbidden [O i] line at 6300 {\AA}. MARCS model atmospheres are applied and non-LTE corrections for the O i triplet are included. Results: Systematic differences between high- and low-alpha halo stars and between thin- and thick-disk stars are seen in the trends of [C/Fe] and [O/Fe]. The two halo populations and thick-disk stars show the same trend of [C/O] versus [O/H], whereas the thin-disk stars are shifted to higher [C/O] values. Furthermore, we find some evidence of higher C/O and C/Fe ratios in stars hosting planets than in stars for which no planets have been detected. Conclusions: The results suggest that C and O in both high- and low-alpha halo stars and in thick-disk stars are made mainly in massive (M> 8 M⊙) stars, whereas thin-disk stars have an additional carbon contribution from low-mass AGB and massive stars of high metallicity causing a rising trend of the C/O ratio with increasing metallicity. However, at the highest metallicities investigated ([Fe/H] ≃ + 0.4), C/O does not exceed 0.8, which seems to exclude formation of carbon planets if proto-planetary disks have the same composition as their parent stars.

Attention was given at all stages of the analysis undertaken to the estimation of errors in the abundances derived for He, O, N, and Ne, relative to H. It was determined that all galaxies are, as expected, defficient in O by factors ranging from 3.5 to 20, and that the abundance of Ne correlates well with that of O, confirming the standard view that Ne, like O, is a primary product of stellar nucleosynthesis.},

Lower luminosity AGB stars show no Li I features, while the very luminous red giants that are identified as massive core-burning supergiants also show no Li I features. The enhanced Li abundances in these luminous AGB stars may be a byproduct of envelope burning in the more massive AGB stars.},

abstract = {Recently improved information on the stellar (n, $\gamma$) cross sections of neutron magic nuclei at N=82, and in particular of 142Nd, turn out to represent a sensitive test for models of s-process nucleosynthesis. While these data were found to be incompatible with the classical approach based on an exponential distribution of neutron exposures, they provide significantly better agreement between the solar abundance distribution of s nuclei and the predictions of models for low-mass asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. The origin of this phenomenon is identified as lying in the high neutron exposures at low neutron density obtained between thermal pulses when 13C burns radiatively in a narrow layer of a few 10-4 Msolar. This effect is studied in some detail, and the influence of the currently available nuclear physics data is discussed with respect to specific further questions. In this context, particular attention is paid to a consistent description of s-process branchings in the region of the rare earth elements. It is shown that, in certain cases, the nuclear data are sufficiently accurate that the resulting abundance uncertainties can be completely attributed to stellar modeling. Thus, the s-process becomes important for testing the role of different stellar masses and metallicities as well as for constraining the assumptions used in describing the low neutron density provided by the 13C source.},

abstract = {Context: In many astrophysical contexts, the helium content of stars may differ significantly from those usually assumed in evolutionary calculations. Aims: In order to improve upon this situation, we have computed tracks and isochrones in the range of initial masses 0.15 - 20 M⊙ for a grid of 39 chemical compositions with the metal content Z between 0.0001 and 0.070 and helium content Y between 0.23 and 0.46. Methods: The Padova stellar evolution code has been implemented with updated physics. New synthetic TP-AGB models allow the extension of stellar models and isochrones until the end of the thermal pulses along the AGB. Software tools for the bidimensional interpolation (in Y and Z) of the tracks have been tuned. Results: This first paper presents tracks for low mass stars (from 0.15 to 2.5 M_⊙) with scaled-solar abundances and the corresponding isochrones from very old ages down to about 1 Gyr. Conclusions: Tracks and isochrones are made available in tabular form for the adopted grid of chemical compositions in the plane Z-Y. As soon as possible an interactive web interface will allow users to obtain isochrones of any chemical composition and also simulated stellar populations with different Y(Z) helium-to-metal enrichment laws.

abstract = {We examine the mass-metallicity relation for z <{\textasciitilde} 1.6. The mass-metallicity relation follows a steep slope with a turnover, or "knee," at stellar masses around 1010 M ⊙. At stellar masses higher than the characteristic turnover mass, the mass-metallicity relation flattens as metallicities begin to saturate. We show that the redshift evolution of the mass-metallicity relation depends only on the evolution of the characteristic turnover mass. The relationship between metallicity and the stellar mass normalized to the characteristic turnover mass is independent of redshift. We find that the redshift-independent slope of the mass-metallicity relation is set by the slope of the relationship between gas mass and stellar mass. The turnover in the mass-metallicity relation occurs when the gas-phase oxygen abundance is high enough that the amount of oxygen locked up in low-mass stars is an appreciable fraction of the amount of oxygen produced by massive stars. The characteristic turnover mass is the stellar mass, where the stellar-to-gas mass ratio is unity. Numerical modeling suggests that the relationship between metallicity and the stellar-to-gas mass ratio is a redshift-independent, universal relationship followed by all galaxies as they evolve. The mass-metallicity relation originates from this more fundamental universal relationship between metallicity and the stellar-to-gas mass ratio. We test the validity of this universal metallicity relation in local galaxies where stellar mass, metallicity, and gas mass measurements are available. The data are consistent with a universal metallicity relation. We derive an equation for estimating the hydrogen gas mass from measurements of stellar mass and metallicity valid for z <{\textasciitilde} 1.6 and predict the cosmological evolution of galactic gas masses.},

abstract = {UVES is a dual beam echelle spectrograph installed at the Nasmyth focus of the UT2 telescope of the ESO VLT since October 1999. It can reach a resolution of 80000 and 115000 in the blue and red arm, respectively. The instrument is characterized by great stability and high efficiency. The smooth operation of both the new telescope and instrument has lead to a remarkable number of highly interesting scientific observations during commissioning.

With enhanced resolution at the hydrogen- and helium-burning shell in the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phases, we are able to model the entire thermally pulsing AGB (TP-AGB) phase. The helium luminosities of the thermal pulses are significantly lower than in higher metallicity stars so there is no third dredge-up. The envelope is enriched in nitrogen by hot-bottom burning of carbon that was previously mixed in during second dredge-up. There is no s-process enrichment owing to the lack of third dredge-up. The thermal pulses grow weaker as the core mass increases and they eventually cease. From then on the star enters a quiescent burning phase which lasts until carbon ignites at the centre of the star when the CO core mass is 1.36Msolar. With such a high degeneracy and a core mass so close to the Chandrasekhar mass, we expect these stars to explode as type 1.5 supernovae, very similar to type Ia supernovae but inside a hydrogen-rich envelope.},

Theoretical modeling predicts that the resulting amplitude increases rapidly with the luminosity of the star. Thus, one might expect oscillations of substantial amplitudes in red giants with high luminosities and vigorous convection. Here we present evidence that such oscillations may in fact have been detected in the so-called semiregular variables, extensive observations of which have been made by amateur astronomers in the American Association for Variable Star Observers. This may offer a new opportunity for studying the physical processes that give rise to the oscillations, possibly leading to further information about the properties of convection in these stars.},

These stars are the most Li-rich massive AGBs found to date, super Li-rich AGBs with log e (Li) {\textasciitilde} 3-4. The high Li overabundances are accompanied by weak or no s-process element (i.e. Rb and Zr) enhancements. A comparison of our observations with the most recent hot bottom burning (HBB) and s-process nucleosynthesis models confirms that HBB is strongly activated during the first TPs but the 22Ne neutron source needs many more TP and third dredge-up episodes to produce enough Rb at the stellar surface. We also show that the short-lived element Tc, usually used as an indicator of AGB genuineness, is not detected in massive AGBs, which is in agreement with the theoretical predictions when the 22Ne neutron source dominates the s-process nucleosynthesis.

abstract = {The von Zeipel theorem is generalised to account for differential rotation in the case of a ``shellular'' rotation law (cf. Zahn 1992). We write this law in the form Omega = Omega (r), a simplification which does not apply to fast rotation. We find that von Zeipel's relation contains a small additional term, generally further increasing the radiative flux at the pole and decreasing it at the equator. We also examine the local Eddington factor in rotating stars and notice some significant differences with respect to current expressions. We examine the latitudinal dependence of the mass loss rates dot {M} (vartheta ) in rotating stars and find two main source of wind anisotropies: 1) the ``geff'' effect which enhances the polar ejection; 2) the ``opacity effect'' (or ``kappa -effect''), which favours equatorial ejection. In O-stars the geff effect is expected to largely dominate. In B- and later type stars the opacity effect should favour equatorial ejection and the formation of equatorial rings. We also examine the behaviour of the wind density and notice a strong enhancement at the equator of B- and later type stars. Possible relations with the polar ejections and the skirt of eta Carinae and with the inner and outer rings of SN 1987 A are mentioned. If dot {M} (vartheta ) has sharp extrema due to some peaks in the opacity law, non equatorial and symmetrical rings may be produced. We also show that the global mass loss rate of a star at a given location in the HR diagram is rapidly increasing with rotation, which is in good agreement with the numerical models by Friend {\&} Abbott (1986). Anisotropic stellar winds remove selectively the angular momentum. For example, winds passing through polar caps in O-stars remove very little angular momentum, an excess of angular momentum is thus retained and rapidly redistributed by horizontal turbulence. These excesses may lead some Wolf-Rayet stars, those resulting directly from O-stars, to be fast spinning objects, while we predict that the WR-stars which have passed through the red supergiant phase will have lower rotation velocities on the average. We also show how anisotropic ejection can be treated in numerical models by properly modifying the outer boundary conditions for the transport of angular momentum. Finally, in an Appendix the equation of the surface for stars with shellular rotation is discussed.},

abstract = {Ultraviolet and X-ray observations show evidence of outflowing gas around many active galactic nuclei. It has been proposed that some of these outflows are driven off gas infalling towards the central supermassive black hole. We perform radiative transfer calculations to compute the gas ionization state and the emergent X-ray spectra for both two- and three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamical simulations of this outflow-from-inflow scenario. By comparison with observations, our results can be used to test the theoretical models and guide future numerical simulations. We predict both absorption and emission features, most of which are formed in a polar funnel of relatively dense (10-20-10-18 g cm-3) outflowing gas. This outflow causes strong absorption for observer orientation angles of ≲35{\textdegree}. Particularly in 3D, the strength of this absorption varies significantly for different lines of sight owing to the fragmentary structure of the gas flow. Although infalling material occupies a large fraction of the simulation volume, we do not find that it imprints strong absorption features in the X-ray spectra since the ionization state is predicted to be very high. Thus, an absence of observed inflow absorption features does not exclude the models. The main spectroscopic consequence of the infalling gas is a Compton-scattered continuum component that partially re-fills the absorption features caused by the outflowing polar funnel. Fluorescence and scattering in the outflow are predicted to give rise to several emission features including a multicomponent Fe K$\alpha$ emission complex for all observer orientations. For the hydrodynamical simulations considered, we predict both ionization states and column densities for the outflowing gas that are too high to be quantitatively consistent with well-observed X-ray absorption systems. Nevertheless, our results are qualitatively encouraging and further exploration of the model parameter space is warranted. Higher resolution hydrodynamic simulations are needed to determine whether the outflows fragment on scales unresolved in our current study, which may yield the denser lower ionization material that could reconcile the models and the observations.},

In addition, we confirm (with new and archival HST data) the presence of a split SGB in 47 Tuc, NGC 1851, and NGC 6388. The fraction of faint SGB stars with respect to the entire SGB population varies from one cluster to another and ranges from {\textasciitilde}0.03 for NGC 362 to {\textasciitilde}0.50 for NGC 6715. The average magnitude difference between the bright SGB and the faint SGB is almost the same at different wavelengths. This peculiarity is consistent with the presence of two groups of stars with either an age difference of about 1-2 Gyr or a significant difference in their overall C+N+O content. Based on observations with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by AURA, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555.},

abstract = {Aims: While spreads in chemical composition are now believed to be a universal characteristic of globular clusters (GCs), not all of them display evidence of multiple populations in their color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs). Here we present a new scenario for the formation of GCs, in an attempt to qualitatively explain these otherwise elusive observational results. Methods: Our scenario divides GCs into three groups, depending on the initial mass (MI) of the progenitor structure (PS), as follows: i) massive PSs can retain the gas ejected by massive stars, including the ejecta of core-collapse SNe. ii) Intermediate-mass PSs can retain at least a fraction of the fast winds of massive stars, but none of the core-collapse SNe ejecta. iii) Low-mass PSs can only retain the slow winds of intermediate-mass stars. The first group would contain members such as $\omega$ Centauri (NGC 5139), M 54 (NGC 6715), M 22 (NGC 6656), and Terzan 5, whereas NGC 2808 (and possibly NGC 2419) would be members of the second group. The remaining GCs that have only a spread in light elements, such as O and Na, would be members of the third group. Results: According to our scenario, the different components of $\omega$ Cen should not have a sizeable spread in age. We argue that this is consistent with the available observations. We present other simple arguments in favor of our scenario, which can be described in terms of two main analytical relations: i) one between the actual observed ratio of the number of first to second generation stars (RSGFG) and the fraction of first generation stars that have been lost by the GC (SL) and ii) another between SL and MI. We also suggest a series of future improvements to and empirical tests of the modeling that may help decide whether the proposed scenario properly describes the chemical evolution of GCs.},

abstract = {A one solar mass, zero-metal star is evolved through the peak of the major core helium flash and compared with models for which the metal abundance is Z = 0.0001 and 0.02. Before central hydrogen is exhausted, and long before the major core helium flash occurs, the Z = 0 model experiences a helium-burning thermal runaway at the center. As this model evolves along the giant branch, recurrent helium-burning thermal runaways are initiated at the base of the hydrogen-burning shell. The thermal structure of the electron-degenerate core of the Z = 0 red giant is completely different from that of the higher Z red giants. As a result of this structure, the major flash begins at a location much farther from the center than in the higher Z cases. Most significantly, during the flash in the Z = 0 model, the outer edge of the convective shell formed in the helium zone extends into layer containing hydrogen, which does not occur in the Z = 0.0001 or Z = 0.02 cases.},

abstract = {Fluorine (19F) abundances (or upper limits) are derived in six extragalactic asymptotic giant branch (AGB) carbon stars from the HF(1-0) R9 line at 2.3358 $\mu$m in high-resolution spectra. The stars belong to the Local Group galaxies, Large Magellanic Cloud, Small Magellanic Cloud, and Carina dwarf spheroidal, spanning more than a factor of 50 in metallicity. This is the first study to probe the behavior of F with metallicity in intrinsic extragalactic C-rich AGB stars. Fluorine could be measured only in four of the target stars, showing a wide range in F enhancements. Our F abundance measurements together with those recently derived in Galactic AGB carbon stars show a correlation with the observed carbon and s-element enhancements. The observed correlations, however, display a different dependence on the stellar metallicity with respect to theoretical predictions in low-mass, low-metallicity AGB models. We briefly discuss the possible reasons for this discrepancy. If our findings are confirmed in a larger number of metal-poor AGBs, the issue of F production in AGB stars will need to be revisited.},

abstract = {Aims: We present the first simulations of the full evolution of super-AGB stars through the entire thermally pulsing AGB phase. We analyse their structural and evolutionary properties and determine the first SAGB yields. Methods: Stellar models of various initial masses and metallicities were computed using standard physical assumptions which prevents the third dredge-up from occurring. A postprocessing nucleosynthesis code was used to compute the SAGB yields, to quantify the effect of the third dredge-up (3DUP), and to assess the uncertainties associated with the treatment of convection. Results: Owing to their massive oxygen-neon core, SAGB stars suffer weak thermal pulses, have very short interpulse periods and develop very high temperatures at the base of their convective envelope (up to 140 {\texttimes} 108 K), leading to very efficient hot bottom burning. SAGB stars are consequently heavy manufacturers of 4He, 13C, and 14N. They are also able to inject significant amounts of 7Li, 17O, 25Mg, and 26,27Al in the interstellar medium. The 3DUP mainly affects the CNO yields, especially in the lower metallicity models. Our post-processing simulations also indicate that changes in the temperature at the base of the convective envelope, which would result from a change in the efficiency of convective energy transport, have a dramatic impact on the yields and represent another major source of uncertainty.

abstract = {We present optical and infrared (IR) observations of the TypeII SN2002hh from 3 to 397d after explosion. The optical spectroscopic (4-397d) and photometric (3-278d) data are complemented by spectroscopic (137-381d) and photometric (137-314d) data acquired at IR wavelengths. This is the first time L-band spectra have ever been successfully obtained for a supernova (SN) at a distance beyond the Local Group. The VRI light curves in the first 40d reveal SN2002hh to be an SNIIP (plateau) - the most common of all core-collapse SNe. SN2002hh is one of the most highly extinguished SNe ever investigated. To provide a match between its early-time spectrum and a coeval spectrum of the TypeIIP SN1999em, as well as maintaining consistency with KI interstellar absorption, we invoke a two-component extinction model. One component is due to the combined effect of the interstellar medium (ISM) of our Milky Way Galaxy and the SN host galaxy, while the other component is due to a `dust pocket' where the grains have a mean size smaller than in the ISM. The early-time optical light curves of SNe1999em and 2002hh are generally well matched, as are the radioactive tails of these two SNe and SN1987A. The late-time similarity of the SN2002hh optical light curves to those of SN1987A, together with measurements of the optical/IR luminosity and [FeII]1.257$\mu$m emission indicate that 0.07 +/- 0.02Msolar of 56Ni was ejected by SN2002hh. However, during the nebular phase the HKL' luminosities of SN2002hh exhibit a growing excess with respect to those of SN1987A. We attribute much of this excess to an IR-echo from a pre-existing, dusty circumstellar medium. Based on an IR-echo interpretation of the near-IR (NIR) excess, we deduce that the progenitor of SN2002hh underwent recent mass-loss of {\textasciitilde}0.3Msolar. A detailed comparison of the late-time optical and NIR spectra of SNe1987A and 2002hh is presented. While the overall impression is one of similarity between the spectra of the two events, there are notable differences. The MgI1.503$\mu$m luminosity of SN2002hh is a factor of 2.5 greater than in SN1987A at similar epochs, yet coeval silicon and calcium lines in SN2002hh are fainter. Interpreting these differences as being due to abundance variations, the overall abundance trend between SN1987A and 2002hh is not consistent with explosion model predictions. It appears that during the burning to intermediate-mass elements, the nucleosynthesis did not progress as far as might have been expected given the mass of iron ejected. Evidence for mixing in the ejecta is presented. Pronounced blueshifts seen in the more isolated lines are attributed to asymmetry in the ejecta. However, during the time-span of these observations ({\textasciitilde}1-yr post-explosion) we find no evidence of dust condensation in the ejecta such as might have been revealed by an increasing blueshift and/or attenuation of the red wings of the emission lines. Nevertheless, the clear detection of first overtone CO emission by 200d and the reddening trend in (K - L')0 suggest that dust formation in the ejecta may occur at later epochs. From the [OI] $\lambda$$\lambda$6300, 6364{\AA} doublet luminosity we infer a 16-18Msolar main-sequence progenitor star. The progenitor of SN2002hh was probably a red supergiant with a substantial, dusty wind.},

The majority of these objects are double periodic pulsators, with periods belonging to both PL ridges. We indicate that in the period -- Wesenheit index plane the oxygen-rich and carbon-rich AGB stars from the NIR PL sequences C, C' and D split into well separated ridges. Thus, we discover an effective method of distinguishing between O-rich and C-rich Miras, SRVs and stars with Long Secondary Periods using their V and I-band photometry. We present an empirical method of estimating the mean K_s magnitudes of the Long Period Variables using single-epoch K_s measurements and complete light curves in the I-band. We utilize these corrected magnitudes to show that the O-rich and C-rich Miras and SRVs follow somewhat different K_s-band PL relations.},

abstract = {The temporal evolution of the optical spectra of various types of supernovae (SNe) is illustrated, in part to aid observers classifying supernova candidates. Type II SNe are defined by the presence of hydrogen, and they exhibit a very wide variety of photometric and spectroscopic properties. Among hydrogen-deficient SNe (Type I), three subclasses are now known: those whose early-time spectra show strong Si II (Ia), prominent He I (Ib), or neither Si II nor He I (Ic). The late-time spectra of SNe Ia consist of a multitude of blended emission lines of iron-group elements; in sharp contrast, those of SNe Ib and SNe Ic (which are similar to each other) are dominated by several relatively unblended lines of intermediate-mass elements. Although SNe Ia, which result from the thermonuclear runaway of white dwarfs, constitute a rather homogeneous subclass, important variations in their photometric and spectroscopic properties are undeniably present. SNe Ib/Ic probably result from core collapse in massive stars largely stripped of their hydrogen (Ib) and helium (Ic) envelopes, and hence they are physically related to SNe II. Indeed, the progenitors of some SNe II seem to have only a low-mass skin of hydrogen; their spectra gradually evolve to resemble those of SNe Ib. In addition to the two well-known photometric subclasses (linear and plateau) of SNe II, which may exhibit minor spectroscopic differences, there is a new subclass (SNe IIn) distinguished by relatively narrow emission lines with little or no P Cygni absorption component and slowly declining light curves. These objects probably have unusually dense circumstellar gas with which the ejecta interact.},

abstract = {We present an empirical s-process abundance distribution derived with explicit knowledge of the r-process component in the low-metallicity globular cluster M22. We have obtained high-resolution, high signal-to-noise spectra for six red giants in M22 using the Magellan Inamori Kyocera Echelle spectrograph on the Magellan-Clay Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory. In each star we derive abundances for 44 species of 40 elements, including 24 elements heavier than zinc (Z = 30) produced by neutron-capture reactions. Previous studies determined that three of these stars (the "r+s group") have an enhancement of s-process material relative to the other three stars (the "r-only group"). We confirm that the r+s group is moderately enriched in Pb relative to the r-only group. Both groups of stars were born with the same amount of r-process material, but s-process material was also present in the gas from which the r+s group formed. The s-process abundances are inconsistent with predictions for asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars with M <= 3 M {\&}sun; and suggest an origin in more massive AGB stars capable of activating the 22Ne($\alpha$,n)25Mg reaction. We calculate the s-process "residual" by subtracting the r-process pattern in the r-only group from the abundances in the r+s group. In contrast to previous r- and s-process decompositions, this approach makes no assumptions about the r- and s-process distributions in the solar system and provides a unique opportunity to explore s-process yields in a metal-poor environment. This paper includes data gathered with the 6.5 m Magellan Telescopes located at Las Campanas Observatory, Chile.},

abstract = {We present a new semiempirical relation for the mass loss of cool stellar winds, which so far has frequently been described by ``Reimers' law.'' Originally, this relation was based solely on dimensional scaling arguments without any physical interpretation. In our approach, the wind is assumed to result from the spillover of the extended chromosphere, possibly associated with the action of waves, especially Alfv{\'e}n waves, which are used as guidance in the derivation of the new formula. We obtain a relation akin to the original Reimers law, but which includes two new factors. They reflect how the chromospheric height depends on gravity and how the mechanical energy flux depends, mainly, on the effective temperature. The new relation is tested and sensitively calibrated by modeling the blue end of the horizontal branch of globular clusters. The most significant difference from mass-loss rates predicted by the Reimers relation is an increase by up to a factor of 3 for luminous late-type (super)giants, in good agreement with observations.},

The yields are based on full evolutionary computations, following the evolution of the stars from the pre-main sequence through the asymptotic giant branch phase, until the external envelope is lost. Independent of metallicity, stars with M < 3 M⊙ are dominated by third dredge-up, thus ejecting into their surroundings gas enriched in carbon and nitrogen. Conversely, hot bottom burning is mainly responsible for the modification of the surface chemistry of more massive stars, whose mass exceeds 3 M⊙: their gas shows traces of proton-capture nucleosynthesis. The extent of hot bottom burning turns out to be strongly dependent on metallicity. Models with Z = 8 {\texttimes} 10-3 achieve a modest depletion of oxygen, barely reaching -0.3 dex, and do not activate the Mg-Al chain. Low-Z models with Z = 3 {\texttimes} 10-4 achieve a strong nucleosynthesis at the bottom of the envelope, with a strong destruction of the surface oxygen and magnesium; the most extreme chemistry is reached for models of mass {\~{ }}6 M⊙, where $\delta$[O/Fe] {\~{ }} -1.2 and $\delta$[Mg/Fe] {\~{ }} -0.6. Sodium is found to be produced in modest quantities at these low Zs, because the initial increase due to the combined effect of the second dredge-up and of 22Ne burning is compensated by the later destruction via proton capture. A great increase by a factor of {\~{ }}10 in the aluminium content of the envelope is also expected. These results can be used to understand the role played by intermediate-mass stars in the self-enrichment scenario of globular clusters: the results from spectroscopic investigations of stars belonging to the second generation of clusters with different metallicity will be used as an indirect test of the reliability of the present yields. The treatment of mass loss and convection is confirmed as the main uncertainties affecting the results obtained in the context of the modelling of the thermal pulses phase. An indirect proof of this comes from the comparison with other investigations in the literature, based on a different prescription for the efficiency of convection in transporting energy and using a different recipe to determine the mass-loss rate.},

abstract = {Numerous spectroscopic and photometric observational studies have provided strong evidence for the widespread presence of multiple stellar populations in globular clusters. In this paper, we study the long-term dynamical evolution of multiple population clusters, focusing on the evolution of the spatial distributions of the first- (FG) and second-generation (SG) stars. In previous studies, we have suggested that SG stars formed from the ejecta of FG AGB stars are expected initially to be concentrated in the cluster inner regions. Here, by means of N-body simulations, we explore the time-scales and the dynamics of the spatial mixing of the FG and the SG populations and their dependence on the SG initial concentration. Our simulations show that, as the evolution proceeds, the radial profile of the SG/FG number ratio, NSG/NFG, is characterized by three regions: (1) a flat inner part; (2) a declining part in which FG stars are increasingly dominant and (3) an outer region where the NSG/NFG profile flattens again (the NSG/NFG profile may rise slightly again in the outermost cluster regions). Until mixing is complete and the NSG/NFG profile is flat over the entire cluster, the radial variation of NSG/NFG implies that the fraction of SG stars determined by observations covering a limited range of radial distances is not, in general, equal to the SG global fraction, (NSG/NFG)glob. The distance at which NSG/NFG equals (NSG/NFG)glob is approximately between 1 and 2 cluster half-mass radii. The time-scale for complete mixing depends on the SG initial concentration, but in all cases complete mixing is expected only for clusters in advanced evolutionary phases, having lost at least 60-70 per cent of their mass due to two-body relaxation (in addition to the early FG loss due to the cluster expansion triggered by SNII ejecta and gas expulsion).The results of our simulations suggest that in many Galactic globular clusters the SG should still be more spatially concentrated than the FG.},

abstract = {We present new determinations of the cosmic expansion history from red-envelope galaxies. We have obtained for this purpose high-quality spectra with the Keck-LRIS spectrograph of red-envelope galaxies in 24 galaxy clusters in the redshift range 0.2 < z < 1.0. We complement these Keck spectra with high-quality, publicly available archival spectra from the SPICES and VVDS surveys. We improve over our previous expansion history measurements in Simon et al. (2005) by providing two new determinations of the expansion history: H(z) = 97{\textpm}62 km sec-1 Mpc-1 at z simeq 0.5 and H(z) = 90{\textpm}40 km sec-1 Mpc-1 at z simeq 0.9. We discuss the uncertainty in the expansion history determination that arises from uncertainties in the synthetic stellar-population models. We then use these new measurements in concert with cosmic-microwave-background (CMB) measurements to constrain cosmological parameters, with a special emphasis on dark-energy parameters and constraints to the curvature. In particular, we demonstrate the usefulness of direct H(z) measurements by constraining the dark-energy equation of state parameterized by w0 and wa and allowing for arbitrary curvature. Further, we also constrain, using only CMB and H(z) data, the number of relativistic degrees of freedom to be 4{\textpm}0.5 and their total mass to be < 0.2 eV, both at 1$\sigma$.},

abstract = {In the low mass star AGB phase the region between H shell and He shell (He-intershell) is affected by brief convective instabilities (Thermal Pulses), due to trigger of the He burning in the He shell. In this conditions the neutron source 22Ne($\alpha$, n)25Mg is marginally activated (releasing a short neuton burst with a peak neutron density n$\le$10 n cm), and may change isotopic ratios near s-path branchings sensitive to the peak neutron density. For each element we analyse the isotopic ratios obtained in the AGB nucleosynthesis model using three different 22Ne($\alpha$, n)25Mg rates: first,with the "standard rate", evaluated in [F. K{\"a}ppeler et al., Astrophys. J. 437, 396 (1994)]; second, with the standard rate multiplied by a factor of two, and third, the standard rate divided by a factor of two. This factor is close to the present uncertainty factor of the 22Ne($\alpha$, n)25Mg rate. The same analysis is presented for 13C($\alpha$, n)16O reaction rate, the primary neutron source in the He-intershell, which works in radiative conditions in a thin region in the top layers of the He-intershell (13C-pocket) during interpulse periods. In this case the standard rate is evaluated in [G.R. Caughlan and W.A. Fowler, Atomic Data Nucl. Data Tables 40, 283 (1988)].},

abstract = {We use our new population synthesis code BONNFIRES to test how surface abundances predicted by rotating stellar models depend on the numerical treatment of rotational mixing, such as spatial resolution, temporal resolution, and computation of mean molecular weight gradients. In stellar evolution codes the process of transporting chemical species and angular momentum is usually approximated as a diffusion process. We find that even with identical numerical prescriptions for calculating the rotational mixing coefficients in the diffusion equation, different timesteps lead to a deviation of the coefficients and hence surface abundances. We find the surface abundances vary by 10-100% between the model sequences with short timestep of 0.001 Myr to model sequences with long timesteps of 0.1-1 Myr. Model sequences with stronger surface nitrogen enrichment also have longer main-sequence lifetimes because more hydrogen is mixed to the burning cores. The deviations in main-sequence lifetimes can be as large as 20%. Mathematically speaking, no numerical scheme can give a perfect solution unless infinitesimally small timesteps are used, which is computationally not practical. However, we find that the surface abundances eventually converge within 10% between modelling sequences with sufficiently small timesteps below 0.1 Myr. The efficiency of rotational mixing depends on the implemented numerical scheme and critically on the computation of the mean molecular weight gradient. A smoothing function for the mean molecular weight gradient results in stronger rotational mixing. When comparing observations with detailed theoretical models made by stellar evolutionary codes or population synthesis codes such as BONNFIRES, deviations of surface abundances because of numerical treatments have to be considered carefully. Calibrations of rotational mixing parameters therefore depend on the chosen discretization schemes. If the discretization scheme or the computational recipe for calculating the mean molecular weight gradient is altered, re-calibration of mixing parameters may be required to fit observations. If we are to properly understand the fundamental physics of rotation in stars, it is crucial that we minimize the uncertainty introduced into stellar evolution models when numerically approximating rotational mixing processes.},

abstract = {The determination of heavy element abundances from planetary nebula (PN) spectra provides an exciting opportunity to study the nucleosynthesis occurring in the progenitor asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star. We perform post-processing calculations on AGB models of a large range of mass and metallicity to obtain predictions for the production of neutron-capture elements up to the first s-process peak at strontium. We find that solar metallicity intermediate-mass AGB models provide a reasonable match to the heavy element composition of Type I PNe. Likewise, many of the Se and Kr enriched PNe are well fitted by lower mass models with solar or close-to-solar metallicities. However, those objects most enriched in Kr and those PN with sub-solar Se/O ratios are difficult to explain with AGB-nucleosynthesis models. Furthermore, we compute s-process abundance predictions for low-mass AGB models of very low metallicity ([Fe/H] {\textasciitilde} -2.3) using both scaled solar and an $\alpha$-enhanced initial composition. For these models, O is dredged to the surface, which means that abundance ratios measured relative to this element (e.g. X/O) do not provide a reliable measure of initial abundance ratios, or of production within the star owing to internal nucleosynthesis.},

abstract = {We describe observed properties of the Type~Iax class of supernovae (SNe~Iax), consisting of SNe observationally similar to its prototypical member, SN~2002cx. The class currently has 25 members, and we present optical photometry and/or optical spectroscopy for most of them. SNe~Iax are spectroscopically similar to SNe~Ia, but have lower maximum-light velocities (2000 |v| 8000~km~s{\textendash}1), typically lower peak magnitudes ({\textendash}14.2 $\ge$ M V, peak {\textendash}18.9~mag), and most have hot photospheres. Relative to SNe~Ia, SNe~Iax have low luminosities for their light-curve shape. There is a correlation between luminosity and light-curve shape, similar to that of SNe~Ia, but offset from that of SNe~Ia and with larger scatter. Despite a host-galaxy morphology distribution that is highly skewed to late-type galaxies without any SNe~Iax discovered in elliptical galaxies, there are several indications that the progenitor stars are white dwarfs (WDs): evidence of C/O burning in their maximum-light spectra, low (typically {\textasciitilde}0.5 M ☉) ejecta masses, strong Fe lines in their late-time spectra, a lack of X-ray detections, and deep limits on massive stars and star formation at the SN sites. However, two SNe~Iax show strong He lines in their spectra. The progenitor system and explosion model that best fits all of the data is a binary system of a C/O WD that accretes matter from a He star and has a deflagration. At least some of the time, this explosion will not disrupt the WD. The small number of SNe in this class prohibit a detailed analysis of the homogeneity and heterogeneity of the entire class. We estimate that in a given volume there are SNe~Iax for every 100 SNe~Ia, and for every 1 M ☉ of iron generated by SNe~Ia at z = 0, SNe~Iax generate {\textasciitilde}0.036 M ☉. Being the largest class of peculiar SNe, thousands of SNe~Iax will be discovered by LSST. Future detailed observations of SNe~Iax should further our understanding of both their progenitor systems and explosions as well as those of SNe~Ia.},

abstract = {By means of detailed chemo-photometric models for elliptical, spiral and irregular galaxies, we evaluate the cosmic history of the production of chemical elements as well as the metal mass density of the present-day Universe. In particular, we study the production rates of some of the most common chemical species (O, Mg, N, Si, Fe and Zn), detected in local stars, Galactic and extragalactic H II regions and high-redshift objects. Such a study allows us to compute in detail the fraction of each element locked up in stars, interstellar gas and intergalactic medium. We then calculate the mean metal abundances for galaxies of different morphological types, along with the average metallicity of galactic matter in the Universe (stars, gas and intergalactic medium). For the average metallicity of galaxies in the local Universe, we find <Z>gal= 0.0175, i.e. close to the solar value. We find the main metal production in spheroids (ellipticals and bulges) to occur at very early times, implying an early peak in the metal production and a subsequent decrease. On the other hand, the metal production in spirals and irregulars is always increasing with time. We find that the average [O/Fe]*,E ratio in stars in spheroids should be +0.4 dex, whereas the average [O/Fe]gas,E ratio in the gas should be -0.33 dex, as a result of the large amount of Fe produced in these systems by Type Ia supernovae after star formation has stopped. The same quantities for spirals are {\textasciitilde}+0.1 dex for the stellar component and almost solar ({\textasciitilde}+0.01 dex) for the gas component. We suggest that a Salpeter-like initial mass function (IMF) is the best candidate for the universal IMF because it allows us to reproduce the majority of observational constraints. We perform a self-consistent census of the baryons and metals in the local Universe finding that, while the vast majority of the baryons lie outside galaxies in the intergalactic medium (IGM), 52 per cent of the metals (with the exception of the Fe-peak elements) are locked up in stars and the interstellar medium. We estimate indirectly the amount of baryons that resides in the IGM and derive its mean Fe abundance, finding a value of XFe,IGM= 0.05 XFe,solar. We believe that this estimate is uncertain by a factor of {\textasciitilde}2, owing to the normalization of the local luminosity function. This means that the Fe abundance of 0.3 solar inferred from X-ray observations of the hot intracluster medium (ICM) is higher than the average Fe abundance of the intergalactic gas in the field.},

abstract = {Evolutionary calculations of low mass stars from the beginning of core helium burning to the white-dwarf configuration are presented. During the giant stage, steady mass loss by a stellar wind has been included according to Reimers's (1975) empirical law. While the evolution follows the Hayashi track up to 34 helium shell flashes are encountered. However, the flash-driven convective helium shells do not reach the overlying hydrogen-rich layers because of the high entropy content of the latter. At the tip of the (asymptotic) giant branch mass loss competes with hydrogen burning, which accelerates the blueward evolution and reduces the time for crossing the H-R diagram toward the white-dwarf region to intervals equal to the interflash periods. Therefore fully developed helium shell flashes can occur at effective temperatures higher than 100,000 K.},

We compare our images to 1.4 GHz maps of Cen A and compute spectral indices using temperature-temperature plots and spectral tomography. We find that the morphologies at 118 MHz and 1.4 GHz match very closely apart from an extra peak in the southern lobe at 118 MHz, which provides tentative evidence for the existence of a southern counterpart to the northern middle lobe of Cen A. Our spatially averaged spectral indices for both the northern and southern lobes are consistent with previous analyses, however we find significant spatial variation of the spectra across the extent of each lobe. Both the spectral-index distribution and the morphology at low radio frequencies support a scenario of multiple outbursts of activity from the central engine. Our results are consistent with inverse-Compton modelling of radio and gamma-ray data that support a value for the lobe age of between 10 and 80 Myr.},

abstract = {Thermonuclear explosions may arise in binary star systems in which a carbon-oxygen (CO) white dwarf (WD) accretes helium-rich material from a companion star. If the accretion rate allows a sufficiently large mass of helium to accumulate prior to ignition of nuclear burning, the helium surface layer may detonate, giving rise to an astrophysical transient. Detonation of the accreted helium layer generates shock waves that propagate into the underlying CO WD. This might directly ignite a detonation of the CO WD at its surface (an edge-lit secondary detonation) or compress the core of the WD sufficiently to trigger a CO detonation near the centre. If either of these ignition mechanisms works, the two detonations (helium and CO) can then release sufficient energy to completely unbind the WD. These 'double-detonation' scenarios for thermonuclear explosion of WDs have previously been investigated as a potential channel for the production of Type Ia supernovae from WDs of {\~{ }} 1 M⊙. Here we extend our 2D studies of the double-detonation model to significantly less massive CO WDs, the explosion of which could produce fainter, more rapidly evolving transients. We investigate the feasibility of triggering a secondary core detonation by shock convergence in low-mass CO WDs and the observable consequences of such a detonation. Our results suggest that core detonation is probable, even for the lowest CO core masses that are likely to be realized in nature. To quantify the observable signatures of core detonation, we compute spectra and light curves for models in which either an edge-lit or compression-triggered CO detonation is assumed to occur. We compare these to synthetic observables for models in which no CO detonation was allowed to occur. If significant shock compression of the CO WD occurs prior to detonation, explosion of the CO WD can produce a sufficiently large mass of radioactive iron-group nuclei to significantly affect the light curves. In particular, this can lead to relatively slow post-maximum decline. If the secondary detonation is edge-lit, however, the CO WD explosion primarily yields intermediate-mass elements that affect the observables more subtly. In this case, near-infrared observations and detailed spectroscopic analysis would be needed to determine whether a core detonation occurred. We comment on the implications of our results for understanding peculiar astrophysical transients including SN 2002bj, SN 2010X and SN 2005E.},

abstract = {We revisit the hypothesis that dense galactic nuclei are formed from inspiraling globular clusters. Recent advances in the understanding of the continuous formation of globular clusters over cosmic time and the concurrent evolution of the galaxy stellar distribution allow us to construct a simple model that matches the observed spatial and mass distributions of clusters in the Galaxy and the giant elliptical galaxy M87. In order to compare with observations, we model the effects of dynamical friction and dynamical evolution, including stellar mass loss, tidal stripping of stars, and tidal disruption of clusters by the growing galactic nucleus. We find that inspiraling globular clusters form a dense central structure, with mass and radius comparable to the typical values in observed nuclear star clusters (NSCs) in late-type and low-mass early-type galaxies. The density contrast associated with the NSC is less pronounced in giant elliptical galaxies. Our results indicate that the NSC mass as a fraction of mass of the galaxy stellar spheroid scales as M_{NSC}/{M_{*}}\approx 0.0025 \, {M_{*}}_{,11}^{-0.5}. Thus disrupted globular clusters could contribute most of the mass of NSCs in galaxies with stellar mass below 1011 M {\&}{\#}9737;. The inner part of the accumulated cluster may seed the growth of a central black hole via stellar dynamical core collapse, thereby relieving the problem of how to form luminous quasars at high redshift. The seed black hole may reach {\textasciitilde}105 M {\&}{\#}9737; within <{\textasciitilde} 1 Gyr of the beginning of globular cluster formation.},

abstract = {CCD vby Str{\"o}mgren photometry of a statistically complete sample of red giants and stars in the main sequence turn-off region in omega Centauri has been used to analyse the apparently complex star formation history of this cluster. From the location of stars in the (b-y),m_1 diagram metallicities have been determined. These have been used to estimate ages of different sub-populations in the color-magnitude diagram and to investigate their spatial distributions. We can confirm several earlier findings. The dominating metal-poor population around -1.7 dex is the oldest population found. More metal-rich stars between [Fe/H]=-1.5 and -1.0 dex tend to be 1-3 Gyr younger. These stars are more concentrated towards the cluster center than the metal-poor ones. The most-metal rich stars around -0.7 dex might be up to 6 Gyr younger than the oldest population. They are asymmetrically distributed around the center with an excess of stars towards the South. We argue that the Str{\"o}mgren metallicity in terms of element abundances has another meaning than in other globular clusters. From a comparison with spectroscopic element abundances, we find the best correlation with the sum C+N. The high Str{\"o}mgren metallicities, if interpreted by strong CN-bands, result from progressively higher N and perhaps C abundances in comparison to iron. The large scatter of Str{\"o}mgren abundances may come from a variety of evolutionary effects, including C-depletion and N-enrichment. We see an enrichment already among the metal-poor population, which is difficult to explain by self-enrichment alone. An attractive speculation (done before) is that omega Cen was the nucleus of a dwarf galaxy. We propose a scenario in which omega Cen experienced mass inflow over a long period of time, until the gas content of its host galaxy was so low that star formation in omega Cen stopped, or alternatively the gas was stripped off during its infall in the Milky Way potential. This mass inflow could have occurred in a clumpy and discontinuous manner, explaining the second peak of metallicities, the abundance pattern, and the asymmetric spatial distribution of the most metal-rich population. Moreover, it explains the kinematic differences found between metal-poor and metal-rich stars.},

On the occasion of the analysis of the oscillations of solar-like pulsator HD 49385, a G0-type star in an advanced stage of evolution, we revisit the phenomenon of the avoided crossings. Christensen-Dalgaard proposed a simple analogy to describe an avoided crossing between two modes. We here present an extension of this analogy to the case of n modes, and show that it should lead, in certain cases, to a characteristic behavior of the eigenfrequencies, significantly different from the n=2 case. This type of behavior seems to be observed in HD 49385, from which we infer that the star should be in a Post Main Sequence phase.},

NGC 1851 has a split subgiant branch which could be due to different ages or C+N+O content while NGC 6752 is representative of the least complex globular clusters. For NGC 1851 and NGC 6752, we obtain average values of A(C+N+O) = 8.16 {\textpm} 0.10 ($\sigma$ = 0.34) and 7.62 {\textpm} 0.02 ($\sigma$ = 0.06), respectively. When taking into account the measurement errors, we find a constant C+N+O abundance sum in NGC 6752. The C+N+O abundance dispersion is only 0.06 dex, and such a result requires that the source of the light element abundance variations does not increase the C+N+O sum in this cluster. For NGC 1851, we confirm a large spread in C+N+O. In this cluster, the anomalous RGB has a higher C+N+O content than the canonical RGB by a factor of 4 ({\~{ }}0.6 dex). This result lends further support to the idea that the two subgiant branches in NGC 1851 are roughly coeval, but with different CNO abundances.},

Taking advantage of the large photometric catalogue published by Pancino et al., we confirm that metal-rich populations have a spatial distribution which is significantly different from the metal-poor dominant population. In particular (i) the different sub-populations have different centroids and (ii) the metal-poor population is elongated along the east-west direction, while the metal-rich populations are oriented along the orthogonal direction, i.e. north-south. The evidence presented here can partially explain the weird spatial metallicity segregation found by Jurcsik, and further supports the hypothesis that different subpopulations in $\omega$ Centauri might have had different origins.},

abstract = {We study the effects of neutron captures in AGB stars on {\textquotedblleft}Fe-group{\textquotedblright} elements, with an emphasis on Cr, Fe, and Ni. These elements show anomalies in 54Cr, 58Fe, and 64Ni in solar system materials, which are commonly attributed to supernovae (SNe). However, as large fractions of the interstellar medium (ISM) were reprocessed in AGB stars, these elements were reprocessed, too. We calculate the effects of such reprocessing on Cr, Fe, and Ni through 1.5 {{M}{\.{o}} } and 3 {{M}{\.{o}} } AGB models, adopting solar and 1/3 solar metallicities. All cases produce excesses of 54Cr, 58Fe, and 64Ni, while the other isotopes are little altered; hence, the observations may be explained by AGB processing. The results are robust and not dependent on the detailed initial isotopic composition. Consequences for other {\textquotedblleft}Fe group{\textquotedblright} elements are then explored. They include 50Ti excesses and some production of 46,47,49Ti. In many circumstellar condensates, Ti quantitatively reflects these effects of AGB neutron captures. Scatter in the data results from small variations (granularity) in the isotopic composition of the local ISM. For Si, the main effects are instead due to variations in the local ISM from different SN sources. The problem of Ca is discussed, particularly with regard to 48Ca. The measured data are usually represented assuming terrestrial values for 42Ca/44Ca. Materials processed in AGB stars or sources with variable initial 42Ca/44Ca ratios can give apparent 48Ca excesses/deficiencies, attributed to SNe. The broader issue of galactic chemical evolution is also discussed in view of the isotopic granularity in the ISM.},

abstract = {Rotation has a number of important effects on the evolution of stars. It decreases the surface gravity, causes enhanced mass loss and leads to surface abundance anomalies of various chemical isotopes. We have adapted the Cambridge stellar evolution code to incorporate a number of different physical models for rotation. We compare detailed grids of stellar evolution models along with simulated stellar populations to identify the key differences between them. Models of rotationally-driven dynamos in stellar radiative zones have suggested that magnetohydrodynamic transport of angular momentum and chemical composition can dominate over the otherwise purely hydrodynamic processes. We have adapted our purely hydrodynamic model to include the evolution of the magnetic field. We consider what effects this has on our populations of rotating stars and how these relate to observational data. Strong magnetic fields are also observed at the end of the stellar lifetime. The surface magnetic field strength of white dwarfs is observed to vary from very little up to 10^9G. We look at how the strongest magnetic fields in white dwarfs may be generated by dynamo action during the common envelope phase of strongly interacting binary stars.},

The advanced diagnostic methods of stellar winds, including an assessment of the accuracy of the determinations of global stellar wind parameters (terminal velocities, mass-loss rates, wind momenta, and energies), are introduced and scaling relations as a function of stellar parameters are provided. Observational results are interpreted in the framework of the stationary, one-dimensional (1-D) theory of line-driven winds. Systematic effects caused by nonhomogeneous structures, time dependence, and deviations from spherical symmetry are discussed. The review finishes with a brief description of the role of stellar winds as extragalactic distance indicators and as tracers of the chemical composition of galaxies at high redshift.},

abstract = {It is shown that the most important source of energy in ordinary stars is the reactions of carbon and nitrogen with protons. These reactions form a cycle in which the original nucleus is reproduced, viz. C12+H=N13, N13=C13+e+, C13+H=N14, N14+H=O15, O15=N15+e+, N15+H=C12 +He4. Thus carbon and nitrogen merely serve as catalysts for the combination of four protons (and two electrons) into an $\alpha$-particle ({\textsection}7). The carbon-nitrogen reactions are unique in their cyclical character ({\textsection}8). For all nuclei lighter than carbon, reaction with protons will lead to the emission of an $\alpha$-particle so that the original nucleus is permanently destroyed. For all nuclei heavier than fluorine, only radiative capture of the protons occurs, also destroying the original nucleus. Oxygen and fluorine reactions mostly lead back to nitrogen. Besides, these heavier nuclei react much more slowly than C and N and are therefore unimportant for the energy production. The agreement of the carbon-nitrogen reactions with observational data ({\textsection}7, 9) is excellent. In order to give the correct energy evolution in the sun, the central temperature of the sun would have to be 18.5 million degrees while integration of the Eddington equations gives 19. For the brilliant star Y Cygni the corresponding figures are 30 and 32. This good agreement holds for all bright stars of the main sequence, but, of course, not for giants. For fainter stars, with lower central temperatures, the reaction H+H=D+e+ and the reactions following it, are believed to be mainly responsible for the energy production. ({\textsection}10) It is shown further ({\textsection}5-6) that no elements heavier than He4 can be built up in ordinary stars. This is due to the fact, mentioned above, that all elements up to boron are disintegrated by proton bombardment ($\alpha$-emission!) rather than built up (by radiative capture). The instability of Be8 reduces the formation of heavier elements still further. The production of neutrons in stars is likewise negligible. The heavier elements found in stars must therefore have existed already when the star was formed. Finally, the suggested mechanism of energy production is used to draw conclusions about astrophysical problems, such as the mass-luminosity relation ({\textsection}10), the stability against temperature changes ({\textsection}11), and stellar evolution ({\textsection}12).},

abstract = {We present 65 optical spectra of the Type Ia SN 2012fr, 33 of which were obtained before maximum light. At early times, SN 2012fr shows clear evidence of a high-velocity feature (HVF) in the Si II $\lambda$6355 line that can be cleanly decoupled from the lower velocity "photospheric" component. This Si II $\lambda$6355 HVF fades by phase -5 subsequently, the photospheric component exhibits a very narrow velocity width and remains at a nearly constant velocity of {\textasciitilde}12,000 km s-1 until at least five weeks after maximum brightness. The Ca II infrared triplet exhibits similar evidence for both a photospheric component at v $\approx$ 12,000 km s-1 with narrow line width and long velocity plateau, as well as an HVF beginning at v $\approx$ 31,000 km s-1 two weeks before maximum. SN 2012fr resides on the border between the "shallow silicon" and "core-normal" subclasses in the Branch et al. classification scheme, and on the border between normal and high-velocity Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) in the Wang et al. system. Though it is a clear member of the "low velocity gradient" group of SNe Ia and exhibits a very slow light-curve decline, it shows key dissimilarities with the overluminous SN 1991T or SN 1999aa subclasses of SNe Ia. SN 2012fr represents a well-observed SN Ia at the luminous end of the normal SN Ia distribution and a key transitional event between nominal spectroscopic subclasses of SNe Ia.},

A combination of this with detailed modeling of all astrophysical and observational contributions to the Malmquist scatter makes it possible to model star-count data without approximating Malmquist corrections.

Its spectral evolution is fairly typical of a type Ia supernova although it suffers high extinction. Nevertheless, there are differences in the spectral evolution when compared to coeval spectra of other normal type Ia supernova with comparable decline-rate parameters. Modelling of the photospheric phase spectra using a homogeneous abundance distribution in the atmosphere provides a fair match to the observations, but only by pushing the adopted distance and risetime close to the observational limits. Future improvements here will require models with a more realistic stratified abundance distribution. From simple modelling of a nebular spectrum obtained at +215 d, we infer a 56Ni mass of 0.69 M_⊙, consistent with that derived from the light curve.},

abstract = {Aims:We propose the Wind of Fast Rotating Massive Stars scenario to explain the origin of the abundance anomalies observed in globular clusters. Methods: We compute and present models of fast rotating stars with initial masses between 20 and 120 M_{\&}sun; for an initial metallicity Z = 0.0005 ([Fe/H]≃-1.5). We discuss the nucleosynthesis in the H-burning core of these objects and present the chemical composition of their ejecta. We consider the impact of uncertainties in the relevant nuclear reaction rates. Results: Fast rotating stars reach critical velocity at the beginning of their evolution and remain near the critical limit during the rest of the main sequence and part of the He-burning phase. As a consequence they lose large amounts of material through a mechanical wind which probably leads to the formation of a slow outflowing disk. The material in this slow wind is enriched in H-burning products and presents abundance patterns similar to the chemical anomalies observed in globular cluster stars. In particular, the C, N, O, Na and Li variations are well reproduced by our model. However the rate of the 24Mg(p,$\gamma$) has to be increased by a factor 1000 around 50 {\texttimes} 106 K in order to reproduce the amplitude of the observed Mg-Al anticorrelation. We discuss how the long-lived low-mass stars currently observed in globular clusters could have formed out of the slow wind material ejected by massive stars.},

The relatively unevolved object that we see today is thought to have accreted some of the AGB star's ejecta via a stellar wind. This simple picture is complicated by the occurrence of mixing of the accreted material in the secondary star, where there are many processes that can potentially alter the surface abundances. We review some of these and discuss their effects on the abundances that we may expect to observe in CEMP stars, assuming our predictions for the AGB stars themselves are correct.},

abstract = {For the first time we explore the circumstellar effects on the Rb (and Zr) abundance determination in O-rich asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars by considering the presence of a gaseous circumstellar envelope with a radial wind. A modified version of the spectral synthesis code Turbospectrum was used to deal with extended atmosphere models and velocity fields. The Rb and Zr abundances were determined from the resonant 7800 {\AA} Rb I line and the 6474 {\AA} ZrO bandhead, respectively, in five representative O-rich AGB stars with different expansion velocities and metallicities. By using our new dynamical models, the Rb I line profile (photospheric and circumstellar components) is very well reproduced. Interestingly, the derived Rb abundances are much lower (by 1-2 dex) in those O-rich AGB stars showing the higher circumstellar expansion velocities. The Zr abundances, however, remain close to the solar values. The Rb abundances and [Rb/Zr] ratios derived here significantly resolve the problem of the present mismatch between the observations of intermediate-mass (4-8 M⊙) Rb-rich AGB stars and the AGB nucleosynthesis theoretical predictions.

abstract = {Detailed stellar evolutionary calculations were carried out for a metal-poor case (Z = 0.001) for stars of initial masses 1.0 Msun, 1.2 Msun, 2.0 Msun, and 3.0 Msun, and for a metal-rich case (Z = 0.02) for stars of initial masses 1.2 Msun and 3.0 Msun. Ongoing mass loss via a Reimers-type wind was included. The latest nuclear reaction rates were used, as well as the latest Los Alamos opacities, including low-temperature carbon opacities and some molecular opacities. The stars were evolved from the main sequence through the red giant branch (RGB), including the helium core flash that occurs in stars of Mi < 2 Msun, through core helium burning on the horizontal branch, and finally through a number of helium shell flashes (thermal pulses) on the asymptotic giant branch. A reasonable wind mass loss rate severely limits the total number of flashes experienced on the AGB, particularly for stars of initial masses Mi 1.2 Msun. Also, it was found that for stars of Z = 0.001, only stars of Mi < 2 Msun experience flashes at a low enough core mass to become carbon stars while still satisfying the observational initial-final mass relation discovered by Weidemann and Koester; it was found that a Reimers wind mass loss is sufficient to account for the total mass loss required by the Weidemann-Koester relation in stars of Mi < 1.5 Msun, but that additional mass loss is required for higher initial masses. It should be noted that the correct choice of Reimers wind parameter $\eta$ depends sensitively on the choice of mixing length (i.e., $\eta$ $\propto$ 1/$\alpha$), composition, and opacities; for low-mass stars of Z = 0.001, a value of $\eta$ = 0.4 is appropriate only for {\#}8alpha; $\approx$ 2. The onset of shell flashes was found to occur considerably earlier in luminosity than indicated by the IbenRenzini relation, allowing flashes to build up in strength before reaching the luminosity domain where carbon stars are observed to exist. This flash onset turned out to occur much lower in luminosity for high-Z stars than for low-Z stars; it was a much steeper function of the star's initial mass for the low-Z case than for the high-Z case. The flash strength L maxHe was not found to level out for the later flashes, but rather to grow linearly, growing faster (and reaching considerably greater strengths) for low-Z stars than for high-Z stars. No evidence was found for the existence of any universal curve giving L maxHe as a function of core mass Mc = MH. This implies that misleading results may be obtained from the commonly used computational shortcut or arbitrarily manipulating envelope mass or core mass in the hopes of simulating the behavior of a star of different initial mass. Other general relations that do exist, including the Mc - Tb and Mc - $\tau$i f relations, turn out to depend appreciably on the composition. The new, increased 12C($\alpha$, $\gamma$)16O reaction rate resulted in carbon-poor, oxygen-rich cores (C {\~{ }} 20%, O {\~{ }} 80%), but had little effect on flash-produced "carbon pocket" abundances (C {\~{ }} 20%, 16O {\~{ }} 2%), nor did any significant 20Ne-production via 16O($\alpha$, $\gamma$) 20Ne result from the increased 16O production. One run (Mi = 3.0 Msun, Z = 0.02) was performed with a new, increased 14N(p, $\gamma$)15 O reaction rate; this proved to have little effect.},

abstract = {In four globular clusters (GCs) a nonnegligible fraction of stars can be interpreted only as a very helium-rich population. The evidence comes from the presence of a ``blue'' main sequence in $\omega$ Cen and NGC 2808, and from the very peculiar horizontal-branch morphology in NGC 6441 and NGC 6388. Although a general consensus is emerging on the fact that self-enrichment is a common feature among GCs, the helium content required for these stars is Y>{\textasciitilde}0.35, and it is difficult to understand how it can be produced without any-or, for $\omega$ Cen, without a considerable-associated metal enhancement. We examine the possible role of super-AGB stars, and show that they may provide the required high helium. However, the ejecta of the most massive super-AGBs show a global CNO enrichment by a factor of {\textasciitilde}=4, due to the dredge-out process occurring at the second dredge-up stage. If these clusters show no evidence for this CNO enrichment, we can rule out that at least the most massive super-AGBs evolve into O-Ne white dwarfs and take part in the formation of the second-generation stars. This latter hypothesis may help to explain the high number of neutron stars present in GCs. The most massive super-AGBs would in fact evolve into electron-capture supernovae. Their envelopes would be easily ejected out of the cluster, but the remnant neutron stars remain in the clusters, thanks to their small supernova natal kicks.},

abstract = {Aims: Many topical astrophysical research areas, such as the properties of planet host stars, the nature of the progenitors of different types of supernovae and gamma ray bursts, and the evolution of galaxies, require complete and homogeneous sets of stellar models at different metallicities in order to be studied during the whole of cosmic history. We present here a first set of models for solar metallicity, where the effects of rotation are accounted for in a homogeneous way. Methods: We computed a grid of 48 different stellar evolutionary tracks, both rotating and non-rotating, at Z = 0.014, spanning a wide mass range from 0.8 to 120 M{\&}sun;. For each of the stellar masses considered, electronic tables provide data for 400 stages along the evolutionary track and at each stage, a set of 43 physical data are given. These grids thus provide an extensive and detailed data basis for comparisons with the observations. The rotating models start on the zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) with a rotation rate $\upsilon$ini/$\upsilon$crit = 0.4. The evolution is computed until the end of the central carbon-burning phase, the early asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase, or the core helium-flash for, respectively, the massive, intermediate, and both low and very low mass stars. The initial abundances are those deduced by Asplund and collaborators, which best fit the observed abundances of massive stars in the solar neighbourhood. We update both the opacities and nuclear reaction rates, and introduce new prescriptions for the mass-loss rates as stars approach the Eddington and/or the critical velocity. We account for both atomic diffusion and magnetic braking in our low-mass star models. Results: The present rotating models provide a good description of the average evolution of non-interacting stars. In particular, they reproduce the observed main-sequence width, the positions of the red giant and supergiant stars in the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram, the observed surface compositions and rotational velocities. Very interestingly, the enhancement of the mass loss during the red-supergiant stage, when the luminosity becomes supra-Eddington in some outer layers, help models above 15-20 M{\&}sun; to lose a significant part of their hydrogen envelope and evolve back into the blue part of the HR diagram. This result has interesting consequences for the blue to red supergiant ratio, the minimum mass for stars to become Wolf-Rayet stars, and the maximum initial mass of stars that explode as type II-P supernovae.

abstract = {Context. The origin of fluorine is a longstanding problem in nuclear astrophysics. It is widely recognized that asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars are among the most important contributors to the Galactic fluorine production. Aims: In general, extant nucleosynthesis models overestimate the fluorine production by AGB stars with respect to observations. Although those differences are rather small at solar metallicity, low metallicity AGB stellar models predict fluorine surface abundances up to one order of magnitude larger than the observed ones. Methods: As part of a project devoted to reducing the uncertainties in the nuclear physics that affect the nucleosynthesis in AGB stellar models, we review the relevant nuclear reaction rates involved in the fluorine production or destruction. We perform this analysis on a model with initial mass M = 2 M⊙ and Z = 0.001. Results: We found that the major uncertainties are due to the 13C($\alpha$,n)16O, the 19F($\alpha$,p)22Ne, and the 14N(p,$\gamma$)15O reactions. A change in the corresponding reaction rates within the present experimental uncertainties implies surface 19F variations at the AGB tip lower than 10%, thus much smaller than observational uncertainties. For some $\alpha$ capture reactions, however, cross sections at astrophysically relevant energies are determined on the basis of nuclear models, in which some low-energy resonance parameters are very poorly known. Thus, larger variations in the rates of those processes cannot be excluded. That being so, we explore the effects of the variation in some $\alpha$ capture rates well beyond the current published uncertainties. The largest 19F variations are obtained by varying the 15N($\alpha$,$\gamma$)19F and the 19F($\alpha$,p)22Ne reactions. Conclusions: The currently estimated uncertainties of the nuclear reaction rates involved in the production and destruction of fluorine produce minor 19F variations in the ejecta of AGB stars. Analysis of some $\alpha$ capture processes that assume a wider uncertainty range determines 19F abundances in better agreement with recent spectroscopic fluorine measurements at low metallicity. In the framework of this scenario, the 15N($\alpha$,$\gamma$)19F and the 19F($\alpha$,p)22Ne reactions show the strongest effects on fluorine nucleosynthesis. The presence of poorly known low-energy resonances make such a scenario possible, even if it is unlikely. We plan to measure these resonances directly.},

abstract = {Context: Abundance analysis of post-AGB objects as probes of AGB nucleosynthesis. Aims: A detailed photospheric abundance study is performed on the carbon-rich post-AGB candidate MACHO 47.2496.8 in the LMC. Methods: High-resolution, high signal-to-noise ESO VLT-UVES spectra of MACHO 47.2496.8 are analysed by performing detailed spectrum synthesis modelling using state-of-the-art carbon-rich MARCS atmosphere models. Results: The spectrum of MACHO 47.2496.8 is not only dominated by bands of carbon bearing molecules, but also by lines of atomic transitions of s-process elements. The metallicity of [Fe/H] = -1.4 is surprisingly low for a field LMC star. The C/O ratio, however difficult to quantify, is greater than 2, and the s-process enrichment is large: the light s-process elements are enhanced by 1.2 dex compared to iron ([ls/Fe] = +1.2), while for the heavy s-process elements an even stronger enrichment is measured: [hs/Fe] = +2.1. The lead abundance is comparable to the [hs/Fe]. With its low intrinsic metallicity and its luminosity at the low end of the carbon star luminosity function, the star represents likely the final stage of a low initial mass star. Conclusions: .The LMC RV Tauri star MACHO 47.2496.8 is highly carbon and s-process enriched, and is most probable a genuine post-C(N-type) AGB star. This is the first detailed abundance analysis of an extragalactic post-AGB star to date.},

abstract = {The last few years has seen a dramatic increase in the number of exoplanets known and in the range of methods for characterising their atmospheric properties. At the same time, new discoveries of increasingly cooler brown dwarfs have pushed down their temperature range which now extends down to Y-dwarfs of <300 K. Modelling of these atmospheres has required the development of new techniques to deal with the molecular chemistry and clouds in these objects. The atmospheres of brown dwarfs are relatively well understood, but some problems remain, in particular the behavior of clouds at the L/T transition. Observational data for exoplanet atmosphere characterization is largely limited to giant exoplanets that are hot because they are near to their star (hot Jupiters) or because they are young and still cooling. For these planets there is good evidence for the presence of CO and H2O absorptions in the IR. Sodium absorption is observed in a number of objects. Reflected light measurements show that some giant exoplanets are very dark, indicating a cloud free atmosphere. However, there is also good evidence for clouds and haze in some other planets. It is also well established that some highly irradiated planets have inflated radii, though the mechanism for this inflation is not yet clear. Some other issues in the composition and structure of giant exoplanet atmospheres such as the occurence of inverted temperature structures, the presence or absence of CO2 and CH4, and the occurrence of high C/O ratios are still the subject of investigation and debate.},

abstract = {Numerical values of charged-particle thermonuclear reaction rates for nuclei in the A=14 to 40 region are tabulated. The results are obtained using a method, based on Monte Carlo techniques, that has been described in the preceding paper of this issue (Paper I). We present a low rate, median rate and high rate which correspond to the 0.16, 0.50 and 0.84 quantiles, respectively, of the cumulative reaction rate distribution. The meaning of these quantities is in general different from the commonly reported, but statistically meaningless expressions, {\textquotedblleft}lower limit{\textquotedblright}, {\textquotedblleft}nominal value{\textquotedblright} and {\textquotedblleft}upper limit{\textquotedblright} of the total reaction rate. In addition, we approximate the Monte Carlo probability density function of the total reaction rate by a lognormal distribution and tabulate the lognormal parameters $\mu$ and $\sigma$ at each temperature. We also provide a quantitative measure (Anderson-Darling test statistic) for the reliability of the lognormal approximation. The user can implement the approximate lognormal reaction rate probability density functions directly in a stellar model code for studies of stellar energy generation and nucleosynthesis. For each reaction, the Monte Carlo reaction rate probability density functions, together with their lognormal approximations, are displayed graphically for selected temperatures in order to provide a visual impression. Our new reaction rates are appropriate for bare nuclei in the laboratory. The nuclear physics input used to derive our reaction rates is presented in the subsequent paper of this issue (Paper III). In the fourth paper of this issue (Paper IV) we compare our new reaction rates to previous results.},

Modifications in the internal structure and evolution of massive stars due to mass loss are explored in terms of core and shell H-burning and core He-burning phases. The influence of mass-loss on the location of stellar objects on the HR diagram and on nucleosynthesis processes is considered, as is the possibility that WR stars are the result of massive star mass-loss. Finally, the galactic distribution of O, blue and red supergiant and WR stars is discussed.},

abstract = {Context: .Extremely metal-poor (EMP) stars preserve a fossil record of the composition of the ISM when the Galaxy formed. It is crucial, however, to verify whether internal mixing has modified their surface composition, especially in the giants where most elements can be studied. Aims: .We aim to understand the CNO abundance variations found in some, but not all EMP field giants analysed earlier. Mixing beyond the first dredge-up of standard models is required, and its origin needs clarification. Methods: .The 12C/^{13C} ratio is the most robust diagnostic of deep mixing, because it is insensitive to the adopted stellar parameters and should be uniformly high in near-primordial gas. We have measured 12C and ^{13C} abundances in 35 EMP giants (including 22 with {[Fe/H] < -3.0}) from high-quality VLT/UVES spectra analysed with LTE model atmospheres. Correlations with other abundance data are used to study the depth of mixing. Results: .The 12C/^{13C} ratio is found to correlate with [C/Fe] (and Li/H), and clearly anti-correlate with [N/Fe], as expected if the surface abundances are modified by CNO processed material from the interior. Evidence for such deep mixing is observed in giants above {log L/L{\&}sun; = 2.6}, brighter than in less metal-poor stars, but matching the bump in the luminosity function in both cases. Three of the mixed stars are also Na- and Al-rich, another signature of deep mixing, but signatures of the ON cycle are not clearly seen in these stars. Conclusions: .Extra mixing processes clearly occur in luminous RGB stars. They cannot be explained by standard convection, nor in a simple way by rotating models. The Na- and Al-rich giants could be AGB stars themselves, but an inhomogeneous early ISM or pollution from a binary companion remain possible alternatives.},

After accounting for the completeness function, the "corrected" MDF does not exhibit the sudden drop at [Fe/H] = -3.6 that was found in recent samples of dwarfs and giants from the Hamburg/ESO survey. Rather, the MDF decreases smoothly down to [Fe/H] = -4.1. Similar results are obtained from the "raw" MDF. We find that the fraction of CEMP objects below [Fe/H] = -3.0 is 23% {\textpm} 6% and 32% {\textpm} 8% when adopting the Beers {\&} Christlieb and Aoki et al. CEMP definitions, respectively. The former value is in fair agreement with some previous measurements, which adopt the Beers {\&} Christlieb criterion.

abstract = {We present a high-resolution spectroscopic analysis of 62 red giants in the Milky Way globular cluster (GC) NGC 5286. We have determined abundances of representative light proton-capture, $\alpha$, Fe-peak and neutron-capture element groups, and combined them with photometry of multiple sequences observed along the colour-magnitude diagram. Our principal results are: (i) a broad, bimodal distribution in s-process element abundance ratios, with two main groups, the s-poor and s-rich groups; (ii) substantial star-to-star Fe variations, with the s-rich stars having higher Fe, e.g. < [Fe/H]> _{s-rich} - < [Fe/H]> _{s-poor} {\~{ }} 0.2 dex; and (iii) the presence of O-Na-Al (anti)correlations in both stellar groups. We have defined a new photometric index, cBVI = (B - V) - (V - I), to maximize the separation in the colour-magnitude diagram between the two stellar groups with different Fe and s-element content, and this index is not significantly affected by variations in light elements (such as the O-Na anticorrelation). The variations in the overall metallicity present in NGC 5286 add this object to the class of anomalous GCs. Furthermore, the chemical abundance pattern of NGC 5286 resembles that observed in some of the anomalous GCs, e.g. M 22, NGC 1851, M 2, and the more extreme $\omega$ Centauri, that also show internal variations in s-elements, and in light elements within stars with different Fe and s-elements content. In view of the common variations in s-elements, we propose the term s-Fe-anomalous GCs to describe this sub-class of objects. The similarities in chemical abundance ratios between these objects strongly suggest similar formation and evolution histories, possibly associated with an origin in tidally disrupted dwarf satellites.},

abstract = {Recent studies suggest that metal-poor stars enhanced in carbon but containing low levels of neutron-capture elements may have been among the first to incorporate the nucleosynthesis products of the first generation of stars. We have observed 16 stars with enhanced carbon or nitrogen using the MIKE Spectrograph on the Magellan Telescopes at Las Campanas Observatory and the Tull Spectrograph on the Smith Telescope at McDonald Observatory. We present radial velocities, stellar parameters, and detailed abundance patterns for these stars. Strontium, yttrium, zirconium, barium, europium, ytterbium, and other heavy elements are detected. In four stars, these heavy elements appear to have originated in some form of r-process nucleosynthesis. In one star, a partial s-process origin is possible. The origin of the heavy elements in the rest of the sample cannot be determined unambiguously. The presence of elements heavier than the iron group offers further evidence that zero-metallicity rapidly rotating massive stars and pair instability supernovae did not contribute substantial amounts of neutron-capture elements to the regions where the stars in our sample formed. If the carbon- or nitrogen-enhanced metal-poor stars with low levels of neutron-capture elements were enriched by products of zero-metallicity supernovae only, then the presence of these heavy elements indicates that at least one form of neutron-capture reaction operated in some of the first stars. This paper includes data gathered with the 6.5 m Magellan Telescopes located at Las Campanas Observatory, Chile, and The McDonald Observatory of The University of Texas at Austin.},

abstract = {Abundances relative to iron for carbon, nitrogen, strontium, and barium are presented for 33 stars on the red giant branch (RGB) of the globular cluster $\omega$ Centauri. They are based on intermediate-resolution spectroscopic data covering the blue spectral region analyzed using spectrum synthesis techniques. The data reveal the existence of a broad range in the abundances of these elements, and a comparison with similar data for main-sequence stars enables insight into the evolutionary history of the cluster. The majority of the RGB stars were found to be depleted in carbon, i.e., [C/Fe] < 0, while [N/Fe] for the same stars shows a range of {\textasciitilde}1 dex, from [N/Fe] $\approx$ 0.7 to 1.7 dex. The strontium-to-iron abundance ratios varied from solar to mildly enhanced (0.0 <= [Sr/Fe] <= 0.8), with [Ba/Fe] generally equal to or greater than [Sr/Fe]. The carbon and nitrogen abundance ratios for the one known CH star in the sample, ROA 279, are [C/Fe] = 0.6 and [N/Fe] = 0.5 dex. Evidence for evolutionary mixing on the RGB is found from the fact that the relative carbon abundances on the main sequence are generally higher than those on the RGB. However, comparison of the RGB and main-sequence samples shows that the upper level of nitrogen enhancement is similar in both sets at [N/Fe] $\approx$ 2.0 dex. This is most likely the result of primordial rather than evolutionary mixing processes. One RGB star, ROA 276, was found to have Sr and Ba abundance ratios similar to the anomalous Sr-rich main-sequence star S2015448. High-resolution spectra of ROA 276 were obtained with the Magellan Telescope/MIKE spectrograph combination to confirm this result, revealing that ROA 276 is indeed an unusual star. For this star, calculations of the depletion effect, the potential change in surface abundance that results from the increased depth of the convective envelope as a star moves from the main sequence to the RGB, strongly suggest that the observed Sr enhancement in ROA 276 is of primordial origin, rather than originating from a surface accretion event. This paper includes data gathered with the 6.5 m Magellan Telescopes located at Las Campanas Observatory, Chile.},

abstract = {The concomitant overabundances of C, N, and s-process elements are commonly ascribed to the complex interplay of nucleosynthesis, mixing, and mass loss taking place in asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. At low metallicity, the enhancement of C and/or N can be up to 1000 times larger than the original iron content and significantly affects the stellar structure and its evolution. For this reason, the interpretation of the already available and still growing amount of data concerning C-rich metal-poor stars belonging to our Galaxy as well as to dwarf spheroidal galaxies would require reliable AGB stellar models for low and very low metallicities. In this paper we address the question of calculation and use of appropriate opacity coefficients, which take into account the C enhancement caused by the third dredge-up. A possible N enhancement, caused by the cool bottom process or by the engulfment of protons into the convective zone generated by a thermal pulse and the subsequent huge third dredge-up, is also considered. Based on up-to-date stellar models, we illustrate the changes induced by the use of these opacity coefficients on the physical and chemical properties expected for these stars.},

abstract = {We analyze in detail various possible sources of systematic errors on the distances of globular clusters derived by fitting a local template DA white dwarf sequence to the cluster counterpart (the so-called WD-fitting technique). We find that the unknown thickness of the hydrogen layer of white dwarfs in clusters plays a non negligible role. For reasonable assumptions - supported by the few sparse available observational constraints - about the unknown mass and thickness of the hydrogen layer for the cluster white dwarfs, a realistic estimate of the systematic error on the distance is within +/-0.10 mag. However, particular combinations of white dwarf masses and envelope thicknesses - which at present cannot be excluded a priori - could produce larger errors. Contamination of the cluster DA sequence by non-DA white dwarfs introduces a very small systematic error of about -0.03 mag in the MV/(V-I) plane, but in the MV/(B-V) plane the systematic error amounts to {\textasciitilde} +0.20 mag. Contamination by white dwarfs with helium cores should not influence appreciably the WD-fitting distances. Finally, we obtain a derivative Delta (m-M)V/Delta E(B-V) {\textasciitilde} -5.5 for the WD-fitting distances, which is very similar to the dependence found when using the Main Sequence fitting technique.},

abstract = {The evolution of rotating stars with zero-age main-sequence (ZAMS) masses in the range 8-25 Msolar is followed through all stages of stable evolution. The initial angular momentum is chosen such that the star's equatorial rotational velocity on the ZAMS ranges from zero to {\textasciitilde}70% of breakup. The stars rotate rigidly on the ZAMS as a consequence of angular momentum redistribution during the pre-main-sequence evolution. Redistribution of angular momentum and chemical species are then followed as a consequence of Eddington-Sweet circulation, Solberg-H{\o}iland instability, the Goldreich-Schubert-Fricke instability, and secular and dynamic shear instability. The effects of the centrifugal force on the stellar structure are included. Convectively unstable zones are assumed to tend toward rigid rotation, and uncertain mixing efficiencies are gauged by observations. We find, as noted in previous work, that rotation increases the helium core masses and enriches the stellar envelopes with products of hydrogen burning. We determine, for the first time, the angular momentum distribution in typical presupernova stars along with their detailed chemical structure. Angular momentum loss due to (nonmagnetic) stellar winds and the redistribution of angular momentum during core hydrogen burning are of crucial importance for the specific angular momentum of the core. Neglecting magnetic fields, we find angular momentum transport from the core to the envelope to be unimportant after core helium burning. We obtain specific angular momenta for the iron core and overlying material of 1016-1017 cm2 s-1. These values are insensitive to the initial angular momentum and to uncertainties in the efficiencies of rotational mixing. They are small enough to avoid triaxial deformations of the iron core before it collapses, but could lead to neutron stars which rotate close to breakup. They are also in the range required for the collapsar model of gamma-ray bursts. The apparent discrepancy with the measured rotation rates of young pulsars is discussed.},

abstract = {Thermally-pulsating AGB stars provide three-fourths of the matter returned to the interstellar medium. The mass and chemical composition of their ejecta largely control the chemical evolution of galaxies. Yet, both the mass loss process and the gas chemical composition remain poorly understood. We present maps of the extended 12CO and 13CO emissions in IRC+10216, the envelope of CW Leo, the high mass loss star the closest to the Sun. IRC+10216 is nearly spherical and expands radially with a velocity of 14.5 km s-1. The observations were made On-the-Fly with the IRAM 30 m telescope; their sensibility, calibration, and angular resolution are far higher than all previous studies. The telescope resolution at $\lambda$ = 1.3 mm (11'' HPBW) corresponds to an expansion time of 500 yr. The CO emission consists of a centrally peaked pedestal and a series of bright, nearly spherical shells. It peaks on CW Leo and remains relatively strong up to rphot = 180''. Further out the emission becomes very weak and vanishes as CO gets photodissociated. As CO is the best tracer of the gas up to rphot, the maps show the mass loss history in the last 8000 yr. The bright CO shells denote over-dense regions. They show that the mass loss process is highly variable on timescales of hundreds of years. The new data, however, do not support previous claims of a strong decrease of the average mass loss in the last few thousand years. The over-dense shells are not perfectly concentric and extend farther to the N-NW. The typical shell separation is 800-1000 yr in the middle of the envelope, but seems to increase outwards. The shell-intershell brightness contrast is $\ge$3. All those key features can be accounted for if CW Leo has a companion star with a period ≃800 yr that increases the mass loss rate when it comes close to periastron. Higher angular resolution observations are needed to fully resolve the dense shells and measure the density contrast. The latter plays an essential role in our understanding of the envelope chemistry. This work was based on observations carried out with the IRAM 30 m telescope.

abstract = {The slow neutron capture process in massive stars (weak s process) produces most of the s-process isotopes between iron and strontium. Neutrons are provided by the 22Ne($\alpha$,n)25Mg reaction, which is activated at the end of the convective He-burning core and in the subsequent convective C-burning shell. The s-process-rich material in the supernova ejecta carries the signature of these two phases. In the past years, new measurements of neutron capture cross sections of isotopes beyond iron significantly changed the predicted weak s-process distribution. The reason is that the variation of the Maxwellian-averaged cross sections (MACS) is propagated to heavier isotopes along the s path. In the light of these results, we present updated nucleosynthesis calculations for a 25 M sun star of Population I (solar metallicity) in convective He-burning core and convective C-burning shell conditions. In comparison with previous simulations based on the Bao et al. compilation, the new measurement of neutron capture cross sections leads to an increase of s-process yields from nickel up to selenium. The variation of the cross section of one isotope along the s-process path is propagated to heavier isotopes, where the propagation efficiency is higher for low cross sections. New 74Ge, 75As, and 78Se MACS result in a higher production of germanium, arsenic, and selenium, thereby reducing the s-process yields of heavier elements by propagation. Results are reported for the He core and for the C shell. In shell C-burning, the s-process nucleosynthesis is more uncertain than in the He core, due to higher MACS uncertainties at higher temperatures. We also analyze the impact of using the new lower solar abundances for CNO isotopes on the s-process predictions, where CNO is the source of 22Ne, and we show that beyond Zn this is affecting the s-process yields more than nuclear or stellar model uncertainties considered in this paper. In particular, using the new updated initial composition, we obtain a high s-process production (overproduction higher than 16O, {\textasciitilde}100) for Cu, Ga, Ge, and As. Using the older abundances by Anders {\&} Grevesse, also Se, Br, Kr, and Rb are efficiently produced. Our results have important implications in explaining the origin of copper in the solar abundance distribution, pointing to a prevailing contribution from the weak s-process in agreement with spectroscopic observations and Galactic chemical evolution calculations. Because of the improvement due to the new MACS for nickel and copper isotopes, the nucleosynthesis of copper is less affected by nuclear uncertainties compared to heavier s-process elements. An experimental determination of the 63Ni MACS is required for a further improvement of the abundance prediction of copper. The available spectroscopic observations of germanium and gallium in stars are also discussed, where most of the cosmic abundances of these elements derives from the s-process in massive stars.},

abstract = {Context: The metal-rich bulge globular cluster NGC 6441 shows both a well-developed blue horizontal branch (Rich et al.), and a strong slope upward from the red clump to the blue of the RR Lyrae region. The former corresponds to the well-known second parameter problem. Both features are not explained by conventional evolutionary models. Aims: Helium self-enrichment is proposed as a possible solution to both questions, a mechanism already invoked for the interpretation of the peculiarities in NGC 2808 and M 13. Methods: We make use of horizontal branch simulations that cover a wide range of main sequence helium abundance to investigate whether the main features of the NGC 6441 horizontal branch population, including the RR Lyrae variables period, can be reproduced. Results: To describe the horizontal branch of NGC 6441, the following must be met. The helium content Y in the red clump must reach at least 0.35; values up to Y{\~{ }}0.37 are necessary to populate the RR Lyr region, also reproducing the observed mean long periods; depending on the dispersion in mass loss assumed in the simulations, values up to Y{\~{ }}0.38-0.40 are necessary to populate the blue HB. The total self-enriched population amounts to {\textasciitilde}60% of the whole stellar content. Conclusions: . Self-enrichment and multiple star-formation episodes in the early evolution of globular clusters appear more and more able to account for many of the chemical and population peculiarities observed in these systems. The very large helium abundances (Y⪆0.35) required for {\textasciitilde}14% of the horizontal branch population pose some problems for the enrichment mechanisms.},

We apply three different mass-loss laws to a 1.5-Msolar star of metallicity Z = 0.008 at the beginning of the thermally pulsing-asymptotic giant branch (TP-AGB) phase. Efficient third dredge-up is found even at very low envelope mass, contrary to previous simulations with other evolution codes. We find that the yield of carbon is uncertain by about 15 per cent and for most other light elements the yield is uncertain at the level of 20-80 per cent. For iron group elements, the uncertainty varies from around 30 per cent for the more-abundant species to over a factor of 2 for the less-abundant radioactive species, like 60Fe. The post-AGB surface abundances for this mass and metallicity are much more uncertain due to the dilution of dredged-up material in differing envelope masses in the later stages of the models. Our results are compared to known planetary nebula and post-AGB abundances. We find that the models are mostly consistent with observations but we are unable to reproduce observations of some of the isotopes.},

Globular cluster orbits are then computed in a time varying gravitational potential after they are either accreted from a satellite halo or formed in situ, within the Milky Way halo. We find that the Galactocentric distances and metallicity distribution of globular clusters are very sensitive to the formation efficiencies of globular clusters as a function of redshift and halo mass. Our most accurate models reveal two distinct peaks in the globular cluster formation efficiency at z {\~{ }} 2 and 7-12 and prefer a formation efficiency that is mildly increasing with decreasing halo mass, the opposite of what expected for feedback-regulated star formation. This model accurately reproduces the positions, velocities, mass function, metallicity distribution, and age distribution of globular clusters in the Milky Way and predicts that {\~{ }}40 per cent formed in situ, within the Milky Way halo, while the other {\~{ }}60 per cent were accreted from about 20 satellite dwarf galaxies with vcir > 30 km s-1, and about 29 per cent of all globular clusters formed at redshifts z > 7. These results further strengthen the notion that globular cluster formation was an important mode of star formation in high-redshift galaxies and likely played a significant role in the reionization of the intergalactic medium.},

abstract = {Nucleosynthetic yield predictions for multidimensional simulations of thermonuclear supernovae generally rely on the tracer particle method to obtain isotopic information of the ejected material for a given supernova simulation. We investigate how many tracer particles are required to determine converged integrated total nucleosynthetic yields. For this purpose, we conduct a resolution study in the number of tracer particles for different hydrodynamical explosion models at fixed spatial resolution. We perform hydrodynamic simulations on a co-expanding Eulerian grid in two dimensions assuming rotational symmetry for both pure deflagration and delayed detonation Type Ia supernova explosions. Within a given explosion model, we vary the number of tracer particles to determine the minimum needed for the method to give a robust prediction of the integrated yields of the most abundant nuclides. For the first time, we relax the usual assumption of constant tracer particle mass and introduce a radially varying distribution of tracer particle masses. We find that the nucleosynthetic yields of the most abundant species (mass fraction >10-5) are reasonably well predicted for a tracer number as small as 32 per axis and direction - more or less independent of the explosion model. We conclude that the number of tracer particles that were used in extant published works appear to have been sufficient as far as integrated yields are concerned for the most copiously produced nuclides. Additionally we find that a suitably chosen tracer mass distribution can improve convergence for nuclei produced in the outer layer of the supernova, where the constant tracer mass prescription suffers from poor spatial resolution.},

Various carbon effects were taken into account and the possible changes in the resulting envelope were investigated. It is found that below 6000 K carbon increased the opacity, due to molecular effects. The opacity peak around 10,000 K was dramatically reduced due to carbon enrichment. From 20,000 to 300,000 K, carbon reduced the opacity by a small amount. Above 300,000 K, carbon increased the opacity by about 20 percent. Carbon did not change the depth of convection in temperature, although in some cases it did drive convection considerably deeper in mass, at a fixed T(e). Carbon shifted stars considerably to the blue in the H-R diagram, leading to a considerably shallower convection in mass, for stars at a fixed envelope mass. Computationally, carbon could be simulated by an equal mass of hydrogen.},

The mosaic in the red arm is made of an EEV chip of the same type and an MIT/LL CCID-20 chip, which features a higher NIR QE and reduce fringing for the redder part of the spectral range. The read noise archived with the CCDs at the telescope is less than 2 electrons for the EEV CCDs and less than 3 electrons for the MIT/LL CCD at a readout speed of 50 kpixel/sec/port. The system s offer a variety of readout modes, binning options and readout speeds up to 625 kilopixel per second per port with linearity variations better than 1 percent peak to peak at a dark current level of around 0.5 electrons/pixel/hour.},

A second reason for observing M22 is the fact that its red giants are rather cool for its metallicity. In connection with the present investigation spectra were obtained of six stars in M22. The six stars selected together with their magnitudes and solar indices are listed in a table, while a journal of the spectroscopic data is presented in another table. It is found that the ratios of several elements relative to iron is not solar. The metal abundances depend sensitively on effective temperature which can best be determined from the color indices. Effective temperatures are derived on the basis of both B-V and the V-K colors corrected for reddening.},

abstract = {We analyze the evolution of binary stars to calculate synthetic rates and delay times of the most promising Type Ia Supernovae (SNe?Ia) progenitors. We present and discuss evolutionary scenarios in which a white dwarf (WD) reaches the Chandrasekhar mass and potentially explodes in a SNe?Ia. We consider Double Degenerate (DDS; merger of two WDs), Single Degenerate (SDS; WD accreting from H-rich companion), and AM Canum Venaticorum (AM CVn; WD accreting from He-rich companion) scenarios. The results are presented for two different star formation histories: burst (elliptical-like galaxies) and continuous (spiral-like galaxies). It is found that delay times for the DDS in our standard model (with common envelope efficiency ?CE = 1) follow a power-law distribution. For the SDS we note a wide range of delay times, while AM CVn progenitors produce a short burst of SNe?Ia at early times. The DDS median delay time falls between {\textasciitilde}0.5 and 1?Gyr; the SDS between {\textasciitilde}2 and 3?Gyr; and the AM CVn between {\textasciitilde}0.8 and 0.6?Gyr depending on the assumed ?CE. For a Milky-Way-like (MW-like) galaxy, we estimate the rates of SNe?Ia arising from different progenitors as: {\textasciitilde}10?4?yr?1 for the SDS and AM CVn, and {\textasciitilde}10?3?yr?1 for the DDS. We point out that only the rates for two merging carbon-oxygen WDs, the only systems found in the DDS, are consistent with the observed rates for typical MW-like spirals. We also note that DDS progenitors are the dominant population in elliptical galaxies. The fact that the delay time distribution for the DDS follows a power law implies more SNe?Ia (per unit mass) in young rather than in aged populations. Our results do not exclude other scenarios, but strongly indicate that the DDS is the dominant channel generating SNe?Ia in spiral galaxies, at least in the framework of our adopted evolutionary models. Since it is believed that WD mergers cannot produce a thermonuclear explosion given the current understanding of accreting WDs, either the evolutionary calculations along with accretion physics are incorrect, or the explosion calculations are inaccurate and need to be revisited.},

We find that the (anti)correlations among the light elements that would be expected on theoretical grounds for matter that has been nuclearly processed via high-temperature proton captures.

Abundances have been determined for over 20 elements in each star. The mean Fe deficiency is -1.6 dex for M13 and -1.8 dex for M3, while M3 is marginally more metal-rich in Mg and Si than M13. Although all elements (with the probable exception of Na) have the same abundance in each of the five M13 stars, considerable scatter exists for Na and Ca and perhaps other elements in the M3 stars. Fe and elements heavier than Fe have the same abundance in each of the three M3 red giants. It appears impossible to explain all the deduced scatter in M3 either by errors in the analysis or by convective mixing.

abstract = {NGC 2419 is a massive outer halo Galactic globular cluster (GC) whose stars have previously been shown to have somewhat peculiar abundance patterns. We have observed seven luminous giants that are members of NGC 2419 with Keck/HIRES at reasonable signal-to-noise ratio. One of these giants is very peculiar, with an extremely low [Mg/Fe] and high [K/Fe] but normal abundances of most other elements. The abundance pattern does not match the nucleosynthetic yields of any supernova model. The other six stars show abundance ratios typical of inner halo Galactic GCs, represented here by a sample of giants in the nearby GC M30. Although our measurements show that NGC 2419 is unusual in some respects, its bulk properties do not provide compelling evidence for a difference between inner and outer halo GCs.

Below the turnoff, the red, the middle, and the blue MS, previously detected from visual-band photometry, are visible over an interval of about 3.5 F160W magnitudes. The three MSs merge together at the level of the MS bend. At fainter magnitudes, the MS again splits into two components containing {\textasciitilde}65% and {\textasciitilde}35% of stars, with the most-populated MS being the bluest one. Theoretical isochrones suggest that the latter is connected to the red MS discovered in the optical color-magnitude diagram (CMD) and hence corresponds to the first stellar generation, having primordial helium and enhanced carbon and oxygen abundances. The less-populated MS in the faint part of the near-IR CMD is helium-rich and poor in carbon and oxygen, and it can be associated with the middle and the blue MS of the optical CMD. The finding that the photometric signature of abundance anti-correlation is also present in fully convective MS stars reinforces the inference that they have a primordial origin.

Both spherical and aspherical geometries are considered and it is shown that moderate departures from sphericity can produce viewing-angle effects that are at least as significant as those caused by the variation of key parameters in 1D models. Thus, $\gamma$-ray data could, in principle, carry some geometrical information, and caution should be applied when discussing the value of $\gamma$-ray data based only on 1D explosion models. In light of the limited sensitivity of current $\gamma$-ray observatories, the computed theoretical spectra are studied to revisit the issue of whether useful constraints could be obtained for moderately nearby objects. The most useful $\gamma$-ray measurements are likely to be of the light curve and time-dependent hardness ratios, but sensitivity higher than currently available, particularly at relatively hard energies ({\textasciitilde}2-3MeV), is desirable.},

abstract = {Planetary nebulae (PNe) are among the most spectacular objects produced by stellar evolution, but the exact identity of their progenitors has never been established for a large and homogeneous sample. We investigate the relationship between PNe and their stellar progenitors in the LMC by means of a statistical comparison between a highly complete spectroscopic catalog of PNe and the spatially resolved age distribution of the underlying stellar populations. We find that most PN progenitors in the LMC have main-sequence lifetimes in a narrow range between 5 and 8 Gyr, which corresponds to masses between 1.2 and 1.0 {{M}{\.{o}} }, and produce PNe that are visible for 27 {\textpm} 6 kyr. We tentatively detect a second population of PN progenitors, with main-sequence lifetimes between 35 and 800 Myr, masses between 8.2 and 2.1 {{M}{\.{o}} }, and average PN lifetimes of 11-8+6 kyr. These two distinct and disjointed populations strongly suggest the existence of at least two physically distinct formation channels for PNe. Our determination of PN lifetimes and progenitor masses has implications for the understanding of PNe in the context of stellar evolution models, and for the role that rotation, magnetic fields, and binarity can play in the shaping of PN morphologies.},

abstract = {It is known that there must be some weak form of transport (called cool bottom processing, or CBP) acting in low-mass red giant branch (RGB) and asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, adding nuclei, newly produced near the hydrogen-burning shell, to the convective envelope. We assume that this extra mixing originates in a stellar dynamo operated by the differential rotation below the envelope, maintaining toroidal magnetic fields near the hydrogen-burning shell. We use a phenomenological approach to the buoyancy of magnetic flux tubes, assuming that they induce matter circulation as needed by CBP models. This establishes requirements on the fields necessary to transport material from zones where some nuclear burning takes place, through the radiative layer and into the convective envelope. Magnetic field strengths are determined by the transport rates needed by CBP for the model stellar structure of a star of initially 1.5 Msolar, in both the AGB and RGB phases. The field required for the AGB star in the processing zone is B0{\textasciitilde}5{\texttimes}106 G; at the base of the convective envelope this yields an intensity BE<{\textasciitilde}104 G. For the RGB case, B0{\textasciitilde}5{\texttimes}104-4{\texttimes}105 G, and the corresponding BE are {\textasciitilde}450-3500 G. These results are consistent with existing observations on AGB stars. They also hint at the basis for high field sources in some planetary nebulae, and the very large fields found in some white dwarfs. It is concluded that transport by magnetic buoyancy should be considered as a possible mechanism for extra mixing through the radiative zone, as is required by both stellar observations and the extensive isotopic data on circumstellar condensates found in meteorites.},

abstract = {Context: AGB stars have long been held responsible for the important star-to-star variations in light elements observed in Galactic globular clusters (GCs). Aims: We analyse the main impacts of a first generation of rotating intermediate-mass stars on the chemical properties of second-generation GC stars. The rotating models were computed without magnetic fields and without the effects of internal gravity waves. They account for the transports by meridional currents and turbulence. Methods: We computed the evolution of both standard and rotating stellar models with initial masses between 2.5 and 8 {M_⊙} within the metallicity range covered by Galactic GCs. Results: During central He-burning, rotational mixing transports fresh CO-rich material from the core towards the hydrogen-burning shell, leading to the production of primary 14N. In stars more massive than M⪆ 4 {M_⊙}, the convective envelope reaches this reservoir during the second dredge-up episode, resulting in a large increase in the total C+N+O content at the stellar surface and in the stellar wind. The corresponding pollution depends on the initial metallicity. At low- and intermediate-metallicity (i.e., [Fe/H] lower than or equal to {\~{ }} -1.2), it is at odds with the constancy of C+N+O observed among GC low-mass stars. Conclusions: With the given input physics, our models suggest that massive (i.e., $\ge$4 {M_⊙}) rotating AGB stars have not shaped the abundance patterns observed in low- and intermediate-metallicity GCs. Our non-rotating models, on the other hand, do not predict surface C+N+O enhancements, hence are in a better position as sources of the chemical anomalies in GCs showing the constancy of the C+N+O. However at the moment, there is no reason to think that intermediate-mass stars were not rotating. On the contrary there is observational evidence that stars in clusters have higher rotational velocities than in the field.},

abstract = {We present late-time radio observations of 68 local Type Ibc supernovae, including six events with broad optical absorption lines (hypernovae). None of these objects exhibit radio emission attributable to off-axis gamma-ray burst jets spreading into our line of sight. Comparison with our afterglow models reveals the following conclusions. (1) Less than {\textasciitilde}10% of Type Ibc supernovae are associated with typical gamma-ray bursts initially directed away from our line of sight; this places an empirical constraint on the GRB beaming factor of f 104, corresponding to an average jet opening angle, $\theta$j 08. (2) This holds in particular for the broad-lined supernovae (SNe 1997dq, 1997ef, 1998ey, 2002ap, 2002bl, and 2003jd), which have been argued to host GRB jets. Our observations reveal no evidence for typical (or even subenergetic) GRBs and rule out the scenario in which every broad-lined SN harbors a GRB at the 84% confidence level. Their large photospheric velocities and asymmetric ejecta (inferred from spectropolarimetry and nebular spectroscopy) appear to be characteristic of the nonrelativistic SN explosion and do not necessarily imply the existence of associated GRB jets.},

abstract = {Context. About a quarter of all post-asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars are hydrogen-deficient. Stellar evolutionary models explain the carbon-dominated H-deficient stars by a (very) late thermal pulse scenario where the hydrogen-rich envelope is mixed with the helium-rich intershell layer. Depending on the particular time at which the final flash occurs, the entire hydrogen envelope may be burned. In contrast, helium-dominated post-AGB stars and their evolution are not yet understood. Aims: A small group of very hot, helium-dominated stars is formed by O(He)-type stars. A precise analysis of their photospheric abundances will establish constraints to their evolution. Methods: We performed a detailed spectral analysis of ultraviolet and optical spectra of four O(He) stars by means of state-of-the-art non-LTE model-atmosphere techniques. Results: We determined effective temperatures, surface gravities, and the abundances of H, He, C, N, O, F, Ne, Si, P, S, Ar, and Fe. By deriving upper limits for the mass-loss rates of the O(He) stars, we found that they do not exhibit enhanced mass-loss. The comparison with evolutionary models shows that the status of the O(He) stars remains uncertain. Their abundances match predictions of a double helium white dwarf (WD) merger scenario, suggesting that they might be the progeny of the compact and of the luminous helium-rich sdO-type stars. The existence of planetary nebulae that do not show helium enrichment around every other O(He) star precludes a merger origin for these stars. These stars must have formed in a different way, for instance via enhanced mass-loss during their post-AGB evolution or a merger within a common-envelope (CE) of a CO-WD and a red giant or AGB star. Conclusions: A helium-dominated stellar evolutionary sequence exists that may be fed by different types of mergers or CE scenarios. It appears likely that all these pass through the O(He) phase just before they become WDs.

The forbidden O I line dublet (6300, 6363) and nearby metallic lines in spectra are analyzed using line analysis and spectral synthesis codes. The Fe/H abundance for M92 is estimated at -2.25 +/-0.02 based on nine giants with a range of 500 K in effective temperature. No evidence for star-to-star variations in the Fe/H abundance was found. O-rich and O-poor stars appear intermixed in the H-R diagram. O - N nuclear synthesis and mixing to the surface are proposed as the best explanation for the low-oxygen giants. The nitrogen abundances obtained earlier for nine of the ten halo field giants in this sample are incompatible with the very large nitrogen abundances expected of the O/Fe abundance of about + 1.2 in halo field subdwarfs, as found by Abia and Rebolo (1989), and not more than 0.6 in halo giants, as found in this and other studies.},

abstract = {The vital importance of composition-dependent low-temperature opacity in low-mass (M <= 3 M ⊙) asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stellar models of metallicity Z >= 0.001 has recently been demonstrated. Its significance to more metal-poor, intermediate-mass (M >= 2.5 M ⊙) models has yet to be investigated. We show that its inclusion in lower-metallicity models ([Fe/H] <=-2) is essential and that there exists no threshold metallicity below which composition-dependent molecular opacity may be neglected. We find it to be crucial in all intermediate-mass models investigated ([Fe/H] <=-2 and 2.5 <= M/M ⊙ <= 5), because of the evolution of the surface chemistry, including the orders of magnitude increase in the abundance of molecule-forming species. Its effect on these models mirrors that previously reported for higher-metallicity models{\textemdash}increase in radius, decrease in T eff, faster mass loss, shorter thermally pulsing AGB lifetime, reduced enrichment in third dredge-up products (by a factor of 3-10), and an increase in the mass limit for hot bottom burning. We show that the evolution of low-metallicity models with composition-dependent low-temperature opacity is relatively independent of initial metal abundance because its contribution to the opacity is far outweighed by changes resulting from dredge-up. Our results imply a significant reduction in the expected number of nitrogen-enhanced metal-poor stars, which may help explain their observed paucity. We note that these findings are partially a product of the macrophysics adopted in our models, in particular, the Vassiliadis {\&} Wood mass loss rate which is strongly dependent on radius.},

abstract = {We investigate whether pure deflagration models of Chandrasekhar-mass carbon-oxygen white dwarf stars can account for one or more subclass of the observed population of Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) explosions. We compute a set of 3D full-star hydrodynamic explosion models, in which the deflagration strength is parametrized using the multispot ignition approach. For each model, we calculate detailed nucleosynthesis yields in a post-processing step with a 384 nuclide nuclear network. We also compute synthetic observables with our 3D Monte Carlo radiative transfer code for comparison with observations. For weak and intermediate deflagration strengths (energy release Enuc ≲ 1.1 {\texttimes} 1051 erg), we find that the explosion leaves behind a bound remnant enriched with 3 to 10 per cent (by mass) of deflagration ashes. However, we do not obtain the large kick velocities recently reported in the literature. We find that weak deflagrations with Enuc {\~{ }} 0.5 {\texttimes} 1051 erg fit well both the light curves and spectra of 2002cx-like SNe Ia, and models with even lower explosion energies could explain some of the fainter members of this subclass. By comparing our synthetic observables with the properties of SNe Ia, we can exclude the brightest, most vigorously ignited models as candidates for any observed class of SN Ia: their B - V colours deviate significantly from both normal and 2002cx-like SNe Ia and they are too bright to be candidates for other subclasses.},

These models were computed under the assumption that the ratio of the initial rotation velocity to the critical velocity of stars is roughly constant with metallicity. This naturally leads to faster rotation at lower metallicity, as metal-poor stars are more compact than metal-rich ones. We find that the new Z = 10-8 stellar yields have a tremendous impact on the nitrogen enrichment of the interstellar medium for log(O/H) + 12 < 7 (or [Fe/H]< -3). We show that including Z = 10-8 stellar yields in chemical evolution models, both high N/O and C/O ratios are obtained in the very-metal poor metallicity range, in agreement with observations. Our results give further support to the idea that stars at very low metallicities could have rotational velocities of the order of 600-800 km s-1.},

abstract = {Nuclear star clusters (NSCs) are often present in spiral galaxies as well as resolved stellar nuclei (SNi) in elliptical galaxies centres. Ever growing observational data indicate the existence of correlations between the properties of these very dense central star aggregates and those of host galaxies, which constitute a significant constraint for the validity of theoretical models of their origin and formation. In the framework of the well-known `migratory and merger' model for NSC and SN formation, in this paper we obtain, first, by a simple argument the expected scaling of the NSC/SN mass with both time and parent galaxy velocity dispersion in the case of dynamical friction as dominant effect on the globular cluster system evolution. This generalizes previous results by Tremaine et al. and is in good agreement with available observational data showing a shallow correlation between NSC/SN mass and galactic bulge velocity dispersion. Moreover, we give statistical relevance to predictions of this formation model, obtaining a set of parameters to correlate with the galactic host parameters. We find that the correlations between the masses of NSCs in the migratory model and the global properties of the hosts reproduce quite well the observed correlations, supporting the validity of the migratory-merger model. In particular, one important result is the flattening or even decrease of the value of the NSC/SN mass obtained by the merger model as function of the galaxy mass for high values of the galactic mass, i.e. ≳3 {\texttimes} 1011 M⊙, in agreement with some growing observational evidence.},

abstract = {New, extended time-series photometry of M3 RR Lyrae stars has revealed that 4 of the 10 double-mode stars show large-amplitude Blazhko modulation of both radial modes. The first, detailed analysis of the peculiar behavior of the unique, Blazhko RRd stars is given. While the P1/P0 period ratio is normal, and the overtone mode is dominant in the other RRd stars of the cluster, the period ratio is anomalous and the fundamental mode has a larger (or similar) mean amplitude than the overtone has in Blazhko RRd stars. The modulations of the fundamental and overtone modes are synchronized only in one of the Blazhko RRd stars. No evidence of any connection between the modulations of the modes in the other three stars is found. The Blazhko modulation accounts, at least partly, for the previously reported amplitude and period changes of these stars. Contrary to the {\textasciitilde}50% Blazhko statistics of RRab and RRd stars, Blazhko modulation occurs only in 10% of the overtone variables in M3. Four of the five Blazhko RRc stars are bright, evolved objects, and one has a period and brightness similar to those of Blazhko RRd stars. The regions of the instability strip with high and low occurrence rates of the Blazhko modulation overlap with the regions populated by first- and second-generation stars according to theoretical and observational studies, raising up the possibility that the Blazhko modulation occurs preferentially in first-generation RR Lyrae stars.},

The four types of planetary nebulas in the order of decreasing heavy element abundances are (1) He and N rich, (2) intermediate population, (3) high velocity, and (4) halo population. The second type is associated with well defined He, N, and O gradients across the galactic disk, and the oxygen gradient is similar to the metallicity gradient derived from GK giants and F main sequence stars.

abstract = {A version of the STARS stellar evolution code has been developed that uses a non-simultaneous solution of the equations of stellar structure and evolution. In all other respects it is identical to the normal, fully simultaneous version. It is therefore possible to test the dependence of the solution on how the equations are solved. Two cases are investigated: a 5- and a 3-Msolar star, both of metallicity Z = 0.02. Prior to the asymptotic giant branch, the models are almost identical. However, once thermal pulses start, the two methods of solution yield diverging results with the non-simultaneous technique predicting longer interpulse periods. This is traced to difficulties associated with hydrogen burning caused by the use of a moving mesh. It is shown that, with careful control of the temporal resolution, the results of the simultaneous technique can be recovered.},

abstract = {A self-consistent model of the chemical evolution of the globular cluster NGC 6752 is presented to test a popular theory that observed abundance anomalies are due to `internal pollution' from intermediate-mass asymptotic giant branch stars. We simulated the chemical evolution of the intracluster medium under the assumption that the products of Type II supernovae are completely expelled from the globular cluster, whereas the material ejected from stars with m<{\textasciitilde} 7 Msolar is retained, due to their weak stellar winds. By tracing the chemical evolution of the intracluster gas we have tested an internal pollution scenario, in which the Na- and Al-enhanced ejecta from intermediate-mass stars is either accreted on to the surfaces of other stars, or goes toward forming new stars. The observed spread in Na and Al was reproduced, but not the O-Na and Mg-Al anticorrelations. In particular, neither O nor Mg are sufficiently depleted to account for the observations. We predict that the Mg content of Na-rich cluster stars should be overwhelmingly dominated by the 25,26Mg isotopes, whereas the latest data show only a mild 26Mg enhancement and no correlation with 25Mg. Furthermore, stars bearing the imprint of intermediate-mass stellar ejecta are predicted to be strongly enhanced in both C and N, in conflict with the empirical data. We show that the NGC 6752 data are not matched by a model incorporating detailed nucleosynthetic yields from asymptotic giant branch stars. Although these stars do show the hot hydrogen burning that seems to be required to explain the observations, this is accompanied by helium burning, producing primary C, N, Mg and Na (via hot-bottom burning) which do not match the observations. Based on current theories of intermediate-mass stellar nucleosynthesis, we conclude that these stars are not responsible for most of the observed globular cluster abundance anomalies.},

abstract = {Abundance trends in heavier elements with evolutionary phase have been shown to exist in the globular cluster NGC 6752 [Fe/H]=-1.6. These trends are a result of atomic diffusion and additional (non-convective) mixing. Studying such trends can provide us with important constraints on the extent to which diffusion modifies the internal structure and surface abundances of solar-type, metal-poor stars. Taking advantage of a larger data sample, we investigate the reality and the size of these abundance trends and address questions and potential biases associated with the various stellar populations that make up NGC6752. Based on uvby Str\"omgren photometry, we are able to separate three stellar populations in NGC 6752 along the evolutionary sequence from the base of the red giant branch down to the turnoff point. We find weak systematic abundance trends with evolutionary phase for Ca, Ti, and Fe which are best explained by stellar-structure models including atomic diffusion with efficient additional mixing. We derive a new value for the initial lithium abundance of NGC 6752 after correcting for the effect of atomic diffusion and additional mixing which falls slightly below the predicted standard BBN value. We find three stellar populations by combining photometric and spectroscopic data of 194 stars in the globular cluster NGC 6752. Abundance trends for groups of elements, differently affected by atomic diffusion and additional mixing, are identified. Although the statistical significance of the individual trends is weak, they all support the notion that atomic diffusion is operational along the evolutionary sequence of NGC 6752.},

On the other hand they exhibit significant variations in the abundances of the light elements, such as Li, C, N, O, and Na. For example, in the GC M4 variations of O and Na by factors larger than 2 and 3, respectively, are not accompanied by variations in the elements from Y to Pb produced by slow neutron captures (the s process). We present models of the s process in intermediate-mass (IM, >4 M⊙) asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, which have been proposed as possible candidates to explain the observed variations. We show that AGB stellar models with stronger mass loss rates produce lower s-process yields, because of a shorter AGB life time. These models are compatible with the observations of M4. The light elements abundances are also affected by the value of the mixing-length parameter alpha MLT, where a larger value results in higher temperatures at the base of the convective envelope during hot bottom burning. This solution is opposite of what is required to match direct observations of the s-process abundances in IM-AGB stars in the Galaxy and in the Magellanic Clouds. However, this cannot be used as a strong constraint while serious problems are still present in current model atmospheres of luminous AGB stars.},

abstract = {Dispersion among the light elements is common in globular clusters (GCs), while dispersion among heavier elements is less common. We present detection of r-process dispersion relative to Fe in 19 red giants of the metal-poor GC M92. Using spectra obtained with the Hydra multi-object spectrograph on the WIYN Telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory, we derive differential abundances for 21 species of 19 elements. The Fe-group elements, plus Y and Zr, are homogeneous at a level of 0.07-0.16 dex. The heavy-elements La, Eu, and Ho exhibit clear star-to-star dispersion spanning 0.5-0.8 dex. The abundances of these elements are correlated with one another, and we demonstrate that they were produced by r-process nucleosynthesis. This r-process dispersion is not correlated with the dispersion in C, N, or Na in M92, indicating that r-process inhomogeneities were present in the gas throughout star formation. The r-process dispersion is similar to that previously observed in the metal-poor GC M15, but its origin in M15 or M92 is unknown at present.

The [Sr/Ba] and [Y/Ba] scatter observed in some galactic halo stars that are very metal-poor and in a few individual stars of the oldest known Milky Way globular cluster NGC 6522 have been interpreted as evidence of early enrichment by massive fast-rotating stars (spinstars). Because NGC 6522 is a bulge globular cluster, the suggestion was that not only the very-metal poor halo stars, but also bulge stars at [Fe/H] {\textasciitilde} -1 could be used as probes of the stellar nucleosynthesis signatures from the earlier generations of massive stars, but at much higher metallicity. For the bulge the suggestions were based on early spectra available for stars in NGC 6522, with a medium resolution of R {\textasciitilde} 22 000 and a moderate signal-to-noise ratio. Aims: The main purpose of this study is to re-analyse the NGC 6522 stars reported previously by using new high-resolution (R {\textasciitilde} 45 000) and high signal-to-noise spectra (S/N > 100). We aim at re-deriving their stellar parameters and elemental ratios, in particular the abundances of the neutron-capture s-process-dominated elements such as Sr, Y, Zr, La, and Ba, and of the r-element Eu. Methods: High-resolution spectra of four giants belonging to the bulge globular cluster NGC 6522 were obtained at the 8m VLT UT2-Kueyen telescope with the UVES spectrograph in FLAMES-UVES configuration. The spectroscopic parameters were derived based on the excitation and ionization equilibrium of Fe i and Fe ii. Results: Our analysis confirms a metallicity [Fe/H] = -0.95 {\textpm} 0.15 for NGC 6522 and the overabundance of the studied stars in Eu (with +0.2 < [Eu/Fe] < + 0.4) and alpha-elements O and Mg. The neutron-capture s-element-dominated Sr, Y, Zr, Ba, and La now show less pronounced variations from star to star. Enhancements are in the range 0.0 < [Sr/Fe] < +0.4, +0.23 < [Y/Fe] < +0.43, 0.0 < [Zr/Fe] < +0.4, 0.0 < [La/Fe] < +0.35, and 0.05 < [Ba/Fe] < +0.55. Conclusions: The very high overabundances of [Y/Fe] previously reported for the four studied stars is not confirmed with the new high-quality spectra. The moderate enhancement in [Sr/Fe] previously reported for one of the re-studied stars is confirmed, but the strong enhancements of this ratio for the other two stars are not confirmed. Despite the moderate enhancements found for the neutron-capture s-element-dominated species, none of the four stars studied here show positive values for all [Sr/Ba], [Y/Ba] and [Zr/Ba] ratios. The re-studied stars are now compatible not only with the interpretation that the s-process enhancements in these very old stars are due to spinstars, but also with alternative models such as mass transfer from s-process-rich AGB stars. Note, however, that when our results are interpreted in the context of more extended datasets from the literature, the spinstar scenario still seems to be favoured.

abstract = {Sodium abundances have been derived for 130 giant stars in the globular cluster M13 from spectra of the Na I doublet at $\lambda$$\lambda$5682 and 5685 {\AA} obtained using the KPNO 4-m Hydra fiber positioner and bench spectrograph. Magnesium abundances have also been obtained for the brightest 98 stars in the sample from the nearby Mg I line at $\lambda$5711 {\AA}. The stars observed in M13 range from the faintest at Mv≃+1.0 and log g≃2.6 up to the tip of the giant branch, and include 18 stars on the asymptotic giant branch. Among the lower luminosity giants, the sodium abundances have a large star-to-star range, approximately from -0.3$\le$[Na/Fe]$\le$+0.5. However, the sodium abundances of the most luminous giants (Mv<-1.7) are usually high; typically, [Na/Fe]$\ge$+0.3, with a much smaller star-to-star scatter. The asymptotic giant branch stars have smaller sodium abundances on average than do the red giant branch tip stars. The spread in [Na/Fe] ratios is larger in M13 than it is among halo field giants of comparable metallicity; M13 contains many more stars with high [Na/Fe] ratios than can be found in the field, even at relatively low luminosities on the giant branch. Magnesium is uniformly overabundant ([Mg/Fe]≃+0.3) in all stars with a low sodium abundance, but the [Mg/Fe] ratio ranges from approximately -0.3 to +0.3 in stars with a high sodium abundance. These sodium and magnesium abundance variations in M13 are discussed in the context of proton capture and deep mixing hypotheses. In addition to the CN and ON hydrogen burning chains previously discussed in the literature, the NeNa and MgAl burning chains have also contributed to the abundance mixture observed in M13 giants. At least some of the products of proton capture chains have been produced in situ in the giants, and brought to the surface, most probably via deep mixing. Evidence in support of the occurrence of proton capture nucleosynthesis and deep mixing among M13 stars includes (1) the absence of sodium-poor stars at the red giant tip, (2) the fact that asymptotic branch stars have lower sodium abundances on average than do stars near the red giant tip, and (3) the existence of a positive correlation between sodium and nitrogen abundances as well as a partial anti-correlation of sodium and magnesium abundances.},

abstract = {Neutrons produced by the carbon fusion reaction 12C (12C ,n )23Mg play an important role in stellar nucleosynthesis. However, past studies have shown large discrepancies between experimental data and theory, leading to an uncertain cross section extrapolation at astrophysical energies. We present the first direct measurement that extends deep into the astrophysical energy range along with a new and improved extrapolation technique based on experimental data from the mirror reaction 12C (12C,p )23Na. The new reaction rate has been determined with a well-defined uncertainty that exceeds the precision required by astrophysics models. Using our constrained rate, we find that 12C (12C,n )23Mg is crucial to the production of Na and Al in pop-III pair instability supernovae. It also plays a nonnegligible role in the production of weak s -process elements, as well as in the production of the important galactic $\gamma$ -ray emitter 60Fe.},

abstract = {We present a new chemical evolution model for the Galaxy that assumes two main infall episodes, for the formation of the halo-thick disk and thin disk, respectively. We do not try to take into account explicitly the evolution of the halo since our model is better suited for computing the evolution of the disk (thick plus thin), but we implicitly assume that the timescale for the formation of the halo was of the same order as the timescale for the formation of the thick disk. The formation of the thin disk is much longer than that of the thick disk, implying that the infalling gas forming the thin disk comes not only from the thick disk but mainly from the intergalactic medium. The timescale for the formation of the thin disk is assumed to be a function of Galactocentric distance, leading to an inside-out picture for the Galaxy's building. The model takes into account the most up-to-date nucleosynthesis prescriptions and adopts a threshold in the star formation process, which naturally produces a hiatus in the star formation rate at the end of the thick-disk phase, as suggested by recent observations. The model results are compared with an extended set of observational constraints both for the solar neighborhood and for the whole disk. Among these constraints, the tightest is the metallicity distribution of the G-dwarf stars, for which new data are now available. Our model fits these new data very well. The model also predicts the evolution of the gas mass, the star formation rate, the supernova rates, and the abundances of 16 chemical elements as functions of time and Galactocentric distance. We show that, in order to reproduce most of these constraints, a timescale of <=1 Gyr for the (halo) thick disk and of 8 Gyr for the thin disk's formation in the solar vicinity are required. We predict that the radial abundance gradients in the inner regions of the disk (R < 1 R⊙) are steeper than in the outer regions, a result confirmed by recent abundance determinations, and that the inner gradients steepen during the Galactic lifetime. The importance and the advantages of assuming a threshold gas density for the onset of the star formation process are discussed.},

In massive stars responsible for the weak component of the s-process, 22Ne($\alpha$,n)25Mg is the dominant source of neutrons, both during core helium burning and in carbon-shell burning. For the main s-process component produced in asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, the 13C($\alpha$,n)16O reaction is the dominant source of neutrons operating during the interpulse period, with the 22Ne+$\alpha$ source affecting mainly the s-process branchings during a thermal pulse. Rate uncertainties in the competing 22Ne($\alpha$,n)25Mg and 22Ne($\alpha$,$\gamma$)26Mg reactions result in large variations of s-process nucleosynthesis. Here, we present up-to-date and statistically rigorous 22Ne+$\alpha$ reaction rates using recent experimental results and Monte Carlo sampling. Our new rates are used in postprocessing nucleosynthesis calculations both for massive stars and AGB stars. We demonstrate that the nucleosynthesis uncertainties arising from the new rates are dramatically reduced in comparison to previously published results, but several ambiguities in the present data must still be addressed. Recommendations for further study to resolve these issues are provided.},

We suggest that omega Centauri might be a cosmological dwarf elliptical, formed at high redshift, evolved in isolation and self-enriched, and eventually fallen inside the potential well of the Milky Way, in agreement with the Searle-Zinn (1978) paradigm for galactic globular cluster formation. We finally suggest that omega Centauri is probably surrounded by an extended Dark Matter (DM) halo, for which no observational evidence is at present available.

abstract = {We revise the scenario of the formation of Galactic globular clusters (GCs) by adding the observed detailed chemical composition of their different stellar generations to the set of their global parameters. We exploit the unprecedented set of homogeneous abundances of more than 1200 red giants in 19 clusters, as well as additional data from literature, to give a new definition of bona fide GCs, as the stellar aggregates showing the Na-O anticorrelation. We propose a classification of GCs according to their kinematics and location in the Galaxy in three populations: disk/bulge, inner halo, and outer halo. We find that the luminosity function of GCs is fairly independent of their population, suggesting that it is imprinted by the formation mechanism only marginally affected by the ensuing evolution. We show that a large fraction of the primordial population should have been lost by the proto-GCs. The extremely low Al abundances found for the primordial population of massive GCs indicate a very fast enrichment process before the formation of the primordial population. We suggest a scenario for the formation of GCs that includes at least three main phases: i) the formation of a precursor population (likely due to the interaction of cosmological structures similar to those that led to the formation of dwarf spheroidals, but residing at smaller Galactocentric distances, with the early Galaxy or with other structures); ii) the triggering of a long episode of star formation (the primordial population) from the precursor population; and iii) the formation of the current GC, mainly within a cooling flow formed by the slow winds of a fraction of the primordial population. The precursor population is very effective in raising the metal content in massive and/or metal-poor (mainly halo) clusters, while its r{\^o}le is minor in small and/or metal-rich (mainly disk) ones. Finally, we use principal component analysis and multivariate relations to study the phase of metal enrichment from first to second generation. We conclude that most of the chemical signatures of GCs may be ascribed to a few parameters, the most important being metallicity, mass, and cluster age. Location within the Galaxy (as described by the kinematics) also plays some r{\^o}le, while additional parameters are required to describe their dynamical status.

abstract = {In this thesis we explore the evolution, nucleosynthesis and final fates of super- and massive asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. Super-AGB stars bridge the divide between low and high mass stars and are characterised by carbon burning within their cores prior to the thermally pulsing phase. We test our implementation of a single composite carbon burning reaction within our stellar evolutionary code by running a series of models, with standardized input physics to compare to previous studies in the literature. In this benchmarking work, which includes phases of evolution up to the cessation of carbon burning, we find excellent agreement between different code results over a large range of metallicities. Due to the fine initial mass resolution grid used to probe the lowest mass models which ignite carbon, a new type of white dwarf is reported, a hybrid CO(Ne) white dwarf, comprising of a CO core surrounded by an ONe shell. Super-AGB stars have long been the ``missing'' mass range in galactic chemical evolution studies due to the lack of stellar yield calculations. To remedy this problem, and assess the impact of the super-AGB star contribution to the galactic chemical inventory of nuclides, an extensive grid of nucleosynthetic yields has been produced for elements up to iron. Since the evolution and element production within stars are strongly dependent on their initial metallicity, we have performed calculations over a wide range of metallicities from Z=0.02 to 0.0001 ([Fe/H]{\textasciitilde} 0 to -2.3). We examine the role that the nucleosynthetic processes of first, second, and third dredge-up, as well as hot bottom burning have on the surface composition within super-AGB stars. Stellar yield calculations are subject to a wide range of uncertainties, in particular the wind mass-loss rate, nuclear reaction rate uncertainties, the theory of convective mixing, and efficiency of third dredge-up. We investigate the impact that these uncertainties have on yield predictions. Our results are compared to other studies in the literature, with the major difference being the occurrence of third dredge-up in our calculations. We apply our nucleosynthetic yield predictions of metallicity Z=0.001 to examine the possible role of super-AGB stars as the polluters of the anomalous stars in the globular cluster NGC 2808. Lastly, we examine the final fates of super-AGB and massive-AGB stars in the mass range 5 to 10 Msun. We produce an extensive grid of detailed evolution calculations along the majority of the thermally pulsing AGB phase. These models are computationally demanding due to the necessity of following a vast number of thermal pulses with very fine temporal and spacial resolution. We provide a theoretical initial to final mass relation for massive and ultra-massive white dwarfs.},

abstract = {This paper explores if the mean properties of early-type galaxies (ETGs) can be reconstructed from `genetic' information stored in their globular clusters (GCs; i.e. in their chemical abundances, spatial distributions and ages). This approach implies that the formation of each globular occurs in very massive stellar environments, as suggested by some models that aim at explaining the presence of multipopulations in these systems. The assumption that the relative number of GCs to diffuse stellar mass depends exponentially on chemical abundance, [Z/H], and the presence of two dominant GC subpopulations (blue and red), allows the mapping of low-metallicity haloes and of higher metallicity (and more heterogeneous) bulges. In particular, the masses of the low-metallicity haloes seem to scale up with dark matter mass through a constant. We also find a dependence of the GC formation efficiency with the mean projected stellar mass density of the galaxies within their effective radii. The analysis is based on a selected subsample of galaxies observed within the ACS Virgo Cluster Survey of the Hubble Space Telescope. These systems were grouped, according to their absolute magnitudes, in order to define composite fiducial galaxies and look for a quantitative connection with their (also composite) GCs systems. The results strengthen the idea that GCs are good quantitative tracers of both baryonic and dark matter in ETGs.},

abstract = {Because calibrated light curves of type Ia supernovae have become a major tool to determine the local expansion rate of the universe and also its geometrical structure, considerable attention has been given to models of these events over the past couple of years. There are good reasons to believe that perhaps most type Ia supernovae are the explosions of white dwarfs that have approached the Chandrasekhar mass, Mchan $\approx$ 1.39Msolar, and are disrupted by thermonuclear fusion of carbon and oxygen. However, the mechanism whereby such accreting carbon-oxygen white dwarfs explode continues to be uncertain. Recent progress in modeling type Ia supernovae as well as several of the still open questions are addressed in this review. Although the main emphasis is on studies of the explosion mechanism itself and on the related physical processes, including the physics of turbulent nuclear combustion in degenerate stars, we also discuss observational constraints.},

abstract = {Asteroseismology of 1.0-2.0 M ⊙ red giants by the Kepler satellite has enabled the first definitive measurements of interior rotation in both first ascent red giant branch (RGB) stars and those on the helium burning clump. The inferred rotation rates are 10-30 days for the $\approx$0.2 M ⊙ He degenerate cores on the RGB and 30-100 days for the He burning core in a clump star. Using the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Evolution code, we calculate state-of-the-art stellar evolution models of low mass rotating stars from the zero-age main sequence to the cooling white dwarf (WD) stage. We include transport of angular momentum due to rotationally induced instabilities and circulations, as well as magnetic fields in radiative zones (generated by the Tayler-Spruit dynamo). We find that all models fail to predict core rotation as slow as observed on the RGB and during core He burning, implying that an unmodeled angular momentum transport process must be operating on the early RGB of low mass stars. Later evolution of the star from the He burning clump to the cooling WD phase appears to be at nearly constant core angular momentum. We also incorporate the adiabatic pulsation code, ADIPLS, to explicitly highlight this shortfall when applied to a specific Kepler asteroseismic target, KIC8366239.},

abstract = {We report the discovery of HATS-5b, a transiting hot Saturn orbiting a G-type star, by the HATSouth survey. HATS-5b has a mass of Mp $\approx$ 0.24 M J, radius of Rp $\approx$ 0.91 R J, and transits its host star with a period of P $\approx$ 4.7634 days. The radius of HATS-5b is consistent with both theoretical and empirical models. The host star has a V-band magnitude of 12.6, mass of 0.94 M ⊙, and radius of 0.87 R ⊙. The relatively high scale height of HATS-5b and the bright, photometrically quiet host star make this planet a favorable target for future transmission spectroscopy follow-up observations. We reexamine the correlations in radius, equilibrium temperature, and metallicity of the close-in gas giants and find hot Jupiter-mass planets to exhibit the strongest dependence between radius and equilibrium temperature. We find no significant dependence in radius and metallicity for the close-in gas giant population. The HATSouth network is operated by a collaboration consisting of Princeton University (PU), the Max Planck Institute f{\"u}r Astronomie (MPIA), and the Australian National University (ANU). The station at Las Campanas Observatory (LCO) of the Carnegie Institute is operated by PU in conjunction with collaborators at the Pontificia Universidad Cat{\'o}lica de Chile (PUC), the station at the High Energy Spectroscopic Survey (HESS) site is operated in conjunction with MPIA, and the station at Siding Spring Observatory (SSO) is operated jointly with ANU. This paper includes data gathered with the 6.5 m Magellan Telescopes located at Las Campanas Observatory, Chile.},

abstract = {Context: In the context of the multiple stellar population scenario in globular clusters (GC), helium (He) has been proposed as the key element to interpret the observed multiple main sequences (MS), subgiant branches (SGB) and red giant branches (RGB), as well as the complex horizontal branch (HB) morphology. However, up to now, He has never been directly measured in GC stars (8500 < T_eff < 11 500 K) to verify this hypothesis. Aims: We studied hot blue horizontal branch (BHB) stars in the GC NGC 6752 to measure their He content. Our goal is to verify the feasibility of He measurement from high resolution spectra in stars cooler than 11 500 K, where chemical abundances are not altered by sedimentation or levitation. Methods: We observed 7 BHB stars using the UVES@VLT2 spectroscopic facility. Spectra of S/N{\textasciitilde}200 were obtained and the very weak He line at 5875 {\AA} measured. We compared this feature with synthetic spectra to obtain He abundances. In addition, iron peak (Fe, Cr), $\alpha$ (Si, Ti), light (O, Na), and s-element (Ba) abundances were measured. Results: We could measure He abundance only for stars warmer than T_eff = 8500 K. All our targets with measurable He are zero age HB (ZAHB) objects and turned out to have a homogeneous He content with a mean value of Y = 0.245{\textpm}0.012, compatible with the most recent measurements of the primordial He content of the Universe (Y{\textasciitilde}0.25). The whole sample of stars has a metallicity of [Fe/H] = -1.56{\textpm}0.03 and [ $\alpha$/Fe] = +0.21{\textpm}0.03, in agreement with other studies available in the literature. Our HB targets show the same Na-O anticorrelation identified among the TO-SGB-RGB stars. Conclusions: This is the first direct measurement of the He abundance for a significative sample of GC stars in a temperature regime where the He content is not altered by sedimentation or extreme mixing as suggested for the hottest, late helium flasher HB stars.},

abstract = {We estimate the rotation speed of Population III (Pop III) stars within a minihalo at z{\~{ }} 20 using a smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulation, beginning from cosmological initial conditions. We follow the evolution of the primordial gas up to densities of 1012 cm-3. Representing the growing hydrostatic cores with accreting sink particles, we measure the velocities and angular momenta of all particles that fall on to these protostellar regions. This allows us to record the angular momentum of the sinks and estimate the rotational velocity of the Pop III stars expected to form within them. The rotation rate has important implications for the evolution of the star, the fate encountered at the end of its life, and the potential for triggering a gamma-ray burst (GRB). We find that there is sufficient angular momentum to yield rapidly rotating stars (≳1000 km s-1, or near break-up speeds). This indicates that Pop III stars likely experienced strong rotational mixing, impacting their structure and nucleosynthetic yields. A subset of them was also likely to result in hypernova explosions and possibly GRBs.},

abstract = {We have investigated chemical evolution in the young universe by analyzing the detailed chemical enrichment pattern of a metal-rich galaxy at high redshift. The recent detection of over 20 elements in the gas phase of a damped Ly$\alpha$ absorber (DLA) at z=2.626 represents an exciting new avenue for exploring early nucleosynthesis. Given a strict upper age of {\textasciitilde}2.5 Gyr and a gas-phase metallicity about 1/3 solar, we have shown the DLA abundance pattern to be consistent with the predictions of a chemical evolution model in which the interstellar enrichment is dominated by massive stars with a small contribution from Type Ia supernovae. Discrepancies between the empirical data and the models are used to highlight outstanding issues in nucleosynthesis theory, including a tendency for Type II supernova models to overestimate the magnitude of the ``odd-even'' effect at subsolar metallicities. Our results suggest a possible need for supplemental sources of magnesium and zinc, beyond that provided by massive stars.},

abstract = {We present new qualitative results of the s-process nucleosynthesis in hot AGB stars resulting from diffusive convective overshooting. In this approach, protons from the convective envelope are injected into the adjacent 12C-rich layers, but depending on the thermodynamic conditions in the mixing zone, the nuclear proton lifetime can be comparable with (or even smaller than) the diffusion timescale. In such a case, the nucleosynthesis and diffusion equations must be coupled. Our simulations indicate that during this diffusive burning phase, the 14N-rich and 13C-rich layers overlap with drastic impact on the s-process distribution. Our study emphasizes the sensitivity of the s-process nucleosynthesis on the temperature of the partial mixing zone. We show that in this framework, a deep hot third dredge-up tends to inhibit the production of s-elements. We also provide a first qualitative estimate of the metallicity and mass dependence of the s-process efficiency in AGB stars and propose that this complex interplay could account for the large variety of the observed s-process efficiencies.},

The reionized universe serves as a mirror to reflect CMB photons, thereby permitting a view of ourselves and the local gravitational potential. By comparing with measurements of the CMB spectrum, a limit is placed on the possibility that we occupy a privileged location, residing at the center of a large void. The Hubble diagram inferred from lines of sight originating at the center of the void may be misinterpreted to indicate cosmic acceleration. Current limits on spectral distortions are shown to exclude the largest voids which mimic cosmic acceleration.

abstract = {We present a detailed analysis of high-resolution, high signal-to-noise ratio spectra for five Aquarius stream stars observed with the Magellan Inamori Kyocera Echelle spectrograph on the Magellan Clay telescope. Our sample represents one-third of the 15 known members in the stream. We find the stream is not monometallic: the metallicity ranges from [Fe/H] = -0.63 to -1.58. No anticorrelation in Na-O abundances is present, and we find a strong positive Mg-Al relationship, similar to that observed in the thick disc. We find no evidence that the stream is a result of a disrupted classical globular cluster, contrary to a previously published claim. High [(Na, Ni, $\alpha$)/Fe] and low [Ba/Y] abundance ratios in the stream suggest that it is not a tidal tail from a disrupted dwarf galaxy, either. The stream is chemically indistinguishable from Milky Way field stars with the exception of one candidate, C222531-145437. From its position, velocity, and detailed chemical abundances, C222531-145437 is likely a star that was tidally disrupted from $\omega$-Centauri. We propose that the Aquarius stream is Galactic in origin, and could be the result of a disc-satellite perturbation in the Milky Way thick disc of the order of a few Gyr ago: derived orbits, UVW velocities, and angular momenta of the Aquarius members offer qualitative support for our hypothesis. Assuming that C222531-145437 is a tidally disrupted member of $\omega$-Centauri, this system is the most likely disc perturber. In the absence of compelling chemical and/or dynamical evidence that the Aquarius stream is the tidal tail of a disrupted satellite, we advocate the `Aquarius group' as a more appropriate description. Like the Canis Major overdensity, as well as the Hercules and Monoceros groups, the Aquarius group joins the list of kinematically identified substructures that are not actually accreted material: they are simply part of the rich complexity of the Milky Way structure.},

abstract = {Context. Solar-like oscillations have been observed by Kepler and CoRoT in several solar-type stars, thereby providing a way to probe the stars using asteroseismology Aims: We provide the mode frequencies of the oscillations of various stars required to perform a comparison with those obtained from stellar modelling. Methods: We used a time series of nine months of data for each star. The 61 stars observed were categorised in three groups: simple, F-like, and mixed-mode. The simple group includes stars for which the identification of the mode degree is obvious. The F-like group includes stars for which the identification of the degree is ambiguous. The mixed-mode group includes evolved stars for which the modes do not follow the asymptotic relation of low-degree frequencies. Following this categorisation, the power spectra of the 61 main-sequence and subgiant stars were analysed using both maximum likelihood estimators and Bayesian estimators, providing individual mode characteristics such as frequencies, linewidths, and mode heights. We developed and describe a methodology for extracting a single set of mode frequencies from multiple sets derived by different methods and individual scientists. We report on how one can assess the quality of the fitted parameters using the likelihood ratio test and the posterior probabilities. Results: We provide the mode frequencies of 61 stars (with their 1-$\sigma$ error bars), as well as their associated {\'e}chelle diagrams.

abstract = {We investigate the enrichment in elements produced by the slow neutron-capture process (s-process) in the globular clusters M4 (NGC 6121) and M22 (NGC 6656). Stars in M4 have homogeneous abundances of Fe and neutron-capture elements, but the entire cluster is enhanced in s-process elements (Sr, Y, Ba, Pb) relative to other clusters with a similar metallicity. In M22, two stellar groups exhibit different abundances of Fe and s-process elements. By subtracting the mean abundances of s-poor from s-rich stars, we derive s-process residuals or empirical s-process distributions for M4 and M22. We find that the s-process distribution in M22 is more weighted toward the heavy s-peak (Ba, La, Ce) and Pb than M4, which has been enriched mostly with light s-peak elements (Sr, Y, Zr). We construct simple chemical evolution models using yields from massive star models that include rotation, which dramatically increases s-process production at low metallicity. We show that our massive star models with rotation rates of up to 50% of the critical (break-up) velocity and changes to the preferred 17O($\alpha$, $\gamma$)21Ne rate produce insufficient heavy s-elements and Pb to match the empirical distributions. For models that incorporate asymptotic giant branch yields, we find that intermediate-mass yields (with a 22Ne neutron source) alone do not reproduce the light-to-heavy s-element ratios for M4 and M22, and that a small contribution from models with a 13C pocket is required. With our assumption that 13C pockets form for initial masses below a transition range between 3.0 and 3.5 M ⊙, we match the light-to-heavy s-element ratio in the s-process residual of M22 and predict a minimum enrichment timescale of between 240 and 360 Myr. Our predicted value is consistent with the 300 Myr upper limit age difference between the two groups derived from isochrone fitting.},

We also analyse four previously known r-process-enhanced metal-poor red giants. From this sample of 13 stars, we draw the following conclusions. (1) High levels of r-process enhancement are found in a broad range of stellar evolutionary states, reaffirming that this phenomenon is not associated with a chemical peculiarity of red giant atmospheres. (2) Only 1 of 10 stars observed at multiple epochs shows radial-velocity variations, reaffirming that stars with high levels of r-process enhancement are not preferentially found among binaries. (3) Only 2 of the 13 stars are highly enhanced in C and N, indicating that there is no connection between high levels of r-process enhancement and high levels of C and N. (4) The dispersions in [Sr/Ba] and [Sr/Eu] are larger than the dispersions in [Ba/Eu] and [Yb/Eu], suggesting that the elements below the second r-process peak do not always scale with those in the rare Earth domain, even within the class of highly-r-process-enhanced stars. (5) The light-element (12 $\le$ Z $\le$ 30) abundances of highly-r-process-enhanced stars are indistinguishable from those with normal levels of r-process material at the limit of our data, 3.5 per cent (0.015 dex) on average. The nucleosynthetic sites responsible for the large r-process enhancements did not produce any detectable light-element abundance signatures distinct from normal core-collapse supernovae.},

abstract = {$\omega$ Centauri is a peculiar globular cluster formed by a complex stellar population. To investigate it, we studied 172 stars belonging to the five SGBs that we can identify in our photometry, in order to measure their [Fe/H] content as well as estimate their age dispersion and the age-metallicity relation. The first important result is that all of these SGBs have a distribution in metallicity with a spread that exceeds the observational errors and typically displays several peaks that indicate the presence of several subpopulations. We were able to identify at least six of them based on their mean [Fe/H] content. These metallicity-based subpopulations are seen to varying extents in each of the five SGBs. Taking advantage of the age sensitivity of the SGB, we showed that, first of all, at least half of the subpopulations have an age spread of at least 2 Gyr. Then, we obtained an age-metallicity relation that is the most complete to date for this cluster. Interpretation of the age-metallicity relation is not straightforward, but it is possible that the cluster (or what we can call its progenitor) was initially composed of two populations with different metallicities. Because of their age, it is very unlikely that the most metal-rich derives from the most metal-poor by some kind of chemical evolution process, so they can be assumed to be two independent primordial objects, or perhaps two separate parts of a single larger object, that merged in the past to form the present-day cluster.

abstract = {Context. The abundances of $\alpha$-elements are a powerful diagnostic of the star formation history and chemical evolution of a galaxy. Sulphur, being moderately volatile, can be reliably measured in the interstellar medium (ISM) of damped Ly-$\alpha$ galaxies and extragalactic H ii regions. Measurements in stars of different metallicity in our Galaxy can then be readily compared to the abundances in external galaxies. Such a comparison is not possible for Si or Ca that suffer depletion onto dust in the ISM. Furthermore, studying sulphur is interesting because it probes nucleosynthetic conditions that are very different from those of O or Mg. In this context measurements in star clusters are a reliable tracers of the Galactic evolution of sulphur. Aims: The aim of this paper is to determine sulphur abundances in several Galactic clusters that span a metallicity range -1.5 < [Fe/H] < 0.0. Methods: We use a standard abundance analysis, based on 1D model atmospheres in local thermodynamical equilibrium (LTE) and literature corrections for non-LTE (NLTE), as well as 3D corrections based on hydrodynamical model atmospheres, to derive sulphur abundances in a sample of stars in the globular cluster M 4, and the open clusters Trumpler 5, NGC 2477, and NGC 5822. Results: We find {\textlangle} A(S) {\textrangle} NLTE = 6.11 {\textpm} 0.04 for M 4, {\textlangle} A(S) {\textrangle} NLTE = 7.17 {\textpm} 0.02 for NGC 2477, and {\textlangle} A(S) {\textrangle} NLTE = 7.13 {\textpm} 0.06 for NGC 5822. For the only star studied in Trumpler 5 we find A(S)NLTE = 6.43 {\textpm} 0.03 and A(S)LTE = 6.94 {\textpm} 0.05. Conclusions: Our measurements show that, by and large, the S abundances in Galactic clusters trace reliably those in field stars. The only possible exception is Trumpler 5, for which the NLTE sulphur abundance implies an [S/Fe] ratio lower by roughly 0.4 dex than observed in field stars of comparable metallicity, even though its LTE sulphur abundance is in line with abundances of field stars. Moreover the LTE sulphur abundance is consistent only with the abundance of another $\alpha$-element, Mg, in the same star, while the low NLTE value is consistent with Si and Ca. We believe that further investigation of departures from LTE is necessary, as well as observation of other S i lines in this star and in other stars of the same cluster, before one can conclude that the sulphur abundance in Trumpler 5 is indeed 0.4 dex lower than in field stars of comparable metallicity. The S abundances in our sample of stars in clusters imply that the clusters are chemically homogeneous for S within 0.05 dex.

The basic formalism is set up, and the method's power is demonstrated by showing that a simplified version of the theory reproduces all the standard results of local convection. The second-order equations of the theory are considered in the limit of a steady state and vanishing third moments, and it is shown that they reproduce all the standard results of local mixing-length convection. There is a particular value of the superadiabatic gradient, below which the only possible steady state of a fluid is nonconvecting. Above this critical value, a fluid is convectively unstable. Two distinct regimes of convection, which are identified as efficient and inefficient convection, are determined.},

abstract = {A new scenario is presented for the production of ^23{Na} in asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. The scenario takes advantage of the periodic third dredge-up episodes characterizing those stars, which mix primary ^12{C} from their intershell layers to their surface. Two successive interpulse/pulse/dredge-up sequences are then required to produce ^23{Na}. During the first sequence carbon and oxygen are converted into ^14{N} by the hydrogen burning shell, and subsequently transformed into ^22{Ne} by the helium burning shell. During the second sequence, ^22{Ne} is converted into ^23{Na} by the hydrogen burning shell, which is brought to the surface by the subsequent dredge-up episode. The ^23{Na} produced by this scenario is thus primary. The efficiency of this scenario is analyzed through standard evolutionary AGB model predictions combined with synthetic calculations for the surface chemical evolution. It is shown that primary ^23{Na} can efficiently be produced as soon as the surface C+N+O abundance enhancement reaches a certain level depending on the stellar metallicity. The required surface C+N+O abundance enhancement amounts to {\textasciitilde} 0.4 dex in solar metallicity stars, and to {\textasciitilde} 0.8 dex at a metallicity five times less than solar. An analytical study of Na production further reveals that the surface ^23{Na} abundance asymptotically evolves to a `line of primary sodium enrichment' (LOPSE) in the [C+N+O]-[^23{Na}] diagram. That LOPSE represents the ^23{Na} abundance evolution predicted in zero metallicity AGB stars experiencing third dredge-up episodes. An analytical relation for the surface ^23{Na} abundance evolution as a function of the surface C+N+O abundance is provided. The predicted surface ^23{Na} enhancements can exceed 0.5 dex depending on the level of surface ^12{C} enrichment, and increases with decreasing stellar metallicity. The quantitative prediction of ^23{Na} surface abundances, however, is presently subject to a high level of uncertainty, partly due to the still poor quantitative prediction of the structural evolution of AGB stars (dredge-up episodes in particular), and partly due to the uncertainties still affecting some nuclear reaction rates (such as ^23{Na} destruction by proton capture). The case of massive AGB stars in which hot bottom burning occurs is also discussed. The production of secondary sodium in those stars is a natural consequence of ^22{Ne} burning in their envelope, if the temperature at the base of the envelope exceeds 70 million K. It requires, however, many interpulses to be significant. The production of primary sodium from the dredge-up of primary ^22{Ne} and its subsequent burning in the envelope, on the other hand, is estimated not to be very efficient, expect maybe in low-metallicity stars. An eventual detection of high Na overabundances in carbon stars or related objects would support the scenario of primary sodium production in AGB stars. Such an observational evidence may have been found in at least one post-AGB star. Further observations of those objects are called for. Observations of ^23{Na} in planetary nebulae are also encouraged. Finally, the production of primary ^23{Na} by AGB stars, if confirmed observationally, may have played a non-negligible role in the chemical evolution of our Galaxy.},

abstract = {We present ultraviolet, optical and near-infrared data of the Type Ibn supernovae (SNe) 2010al and 2011hw. SN 2010al reaches an absolute magnitude at peak of MR = -18.86 {\textpm} 0.21. Its early light curve shows similarities with normal SNe Ib, with a rise to maximum slower than most SNe Ibn. The spectra are dominated by a blue continuum at early stages, with narrow P-Cygni He I lines indicating the presence of a slow-moving, He-rich circumstellar medium. At later epochs, the spectra well match those of the prototypical SN Ibn 2006jc, although the broader lines suggest that a significant amount of He was still present in the stellar envelope at the time of the explosion. SN 2011hw is somewhat different. It was discovered after the first maximum, but the light curve shows a double peak. The absolute magnitude at discovery is similar to that of the second peak (MR = -18.59 {\textpm} 0.25), and slightly fainter than the average of SNe Ibn. Though the spectra of SN 2011hw are similar to those of SN 2006jc, coronal lines and narrow Balmer lines are clearly detected. This indicates substantial interaction of the SN ejecta with He-rich, but not H-free, circumstellar material. The spectra of SN 2011hw suggest that it is a transitional SN Ibn/IIn event similar to SN 2005la. While for SN 2010al the spectrophotometric evolution favours a H-deprived Wolf-Rayet progenitor (of WN-type), we agree with the conclusion of Smith et al. that the precursor of SN 2011hw was likely in transition from a luminous blue variable to an early Wolf-Rayet (Ofpe/WN9) stage.},

In this work, all the main microphysics inputs have been updated, and in particular $\alpha$-enhancement is explicitly taken into account in both the opacities and equation of state. Aims: The target of this work is to provide a basis for testing the reliability of the AGB self-enrichment scenario for globular clusters of intermediate metallicity. These globular clusters exhibit well-defined abundance patterns, which have often been interpreted as the consequence of the pollution of the interstellar medium by the ejecta of massive AGBs. Methods: We calculated a grid of intermediate-mass models with metallicity Z = 0.001; the evolutionary sequences are followed from the pre-main sequence throughout the whole AGB phase. We focus our attention on those elements widely studied in the spectroscopic investigations of globular clusters stars, i.e. oxygen, sodium, aluminium, magnesium, and fluorine. Results: The predictions of our models show an encouraging agreement with the demand of the self-enrichment scenario for what concerns the abundances of oxygen, aluminium, fluorine, and magnesium. The question of sodium is more tricky, due to the large uncertainties of the cross-sections of the Ne-Na cycle. The present results show that only a relatively narrow range of initial masses (M = 5,6 M⊙) can be responsible for the self enrichment.},

We confirm and expand on previous results for these clusters by showing that (1) all elements heavier than, and including, Si have constant abundances within each cluster, (2) the elements from Ca to Ni have indistinguishable compositions in M4 and M5, (3) Si, Cu, Zn, and all s-process elements are approximately 0.3 dex overabundant in M4 relative to M5, and (4) the r-process elements Sm, Eu, Gd, and Th are slightly overabundant in M5 relative to M4. The cluster-to-cluster abundance differences for Cu and Zn are intriguing, especially in light of their uncertain nucleosynthetic origins. We confirm that stars other than Type Ia supernovae must produce significant amounts of Cu and Zn at or below the clusters' metallicities. If intermediate-mass AGB stars or massive stars are responsible for the Cu and Zn enhancements in M4, the similar [Rb/Zr] ratios and (preliminary) Mg isotope ratios in both clusters may be problematic for either scenario. For the elements from Ba to Hf, we assume that the s- and r-process contributions are scaled versions of the solar s- and r-process abundances. We quantify the relative fractions of s- and r-process material for each cluster and show that they provide an excellent fit to the observed abundances.

The successive increase in maximum helium burning luminosity from the 10th to the 18th pulse is calculated, along with the corresponding increase in the temperature at the base of the convective shell and in the amount of matter containing fresh carbon that is dredged up by the convective envelope. The mass of carbon-rich matter dredged up near the end of the 18th pulse is found to be more than one third of the mass through which the hydrogen-burning shell has advanced during the preceding interpulse phase. It is shown that failure of the outer edge of the convective shell to reach the hydrogen-helium interface may be attributed to an 'entropy barrier' set up through this interface during the interpulse phase and that radiation pressure is the dominant contributor to the magnitude of this barrier. Similarly, the dredging-up phenomenon can be interpreted in terms of widely different rates of entropy change on either side of the hydrogen-helium interface},

abstract = {The purpose of this thesis is to investigate mixing in red-giant stars. Thanks particularly to the observations of globular clusters, it is clear that that standard stellar evolution fails to reproduce measured stellar abundances as a function of (red giant branch) luminosity. The empirical data has demonstrated that theorists are missing vital physics in their codes during this phase of evolution. Solutions to this problem have been postulated for many decades now, with mechanisms attributed (but not limited) to rotation, magnetic fields or internal gravity waves. A recently suggested instability, namely thermohaline mixing, serves as the focus of this investigation. It is caused by the competition between heat and chemical diffusion and is only possible due to the unique conditions following dredge-up events. Using observations of lithium and carbon we determine whether this mechanism and/or its current parameterisation can influence the surface composition of red giant branch stars. The quality of the data collected from the Very Large Telescope in Chile, some of which is gathered from our own observing programs, allows us to further constrain the mixing process(es)involved and improve the stellar models.},

The 5 and 6 Msun cases encountered hot bottom burning, with temperatures at the base of the convective envelope reaching (60-80) {\texttimes} 106 K for Z = 0.02 and (80-100) {\texttimes} 106 K for Z = 0.001. A luminosity boundary near MCbol {\~{ }} -6.4 is predicted; for brighter luminosities, hot bottom burning will prevent carbon star formation (these will be S stars, with 3 ≲ 12C/13C ≲ 18, and for a period they will be super lithium-rich). For luminosities fainter than MCbol, carbon stars can be formed as well as S stars, with values of 12C/13C ≳ 14. This luminosity boundary MCbol is rather insensitive to metallicity, to changes in low-temperature molecular opacities, to changes in the mass-loss rate, and to the presence or absence of helium core breathing pulses during the earlier core helium burning stage. To burn envelope carbon significantly requires base temperatures {\~{ }}80 {\texttimes} 106 K. Since only {\~{ }}50 {\texttimes} 106 K is required to produce super-rich lithium stars, some of the most luminosity carbon can be super lithium-rich. The higher metallicity stars spend a larger fraction of their time on the asymptotic giant branch passing through this base temperature range of (50-80) {\texttimes} 106 K; thus super lithium-rich carbon stars are more probable for higher metallicities. The above predictions are in excellent agreement with observations of carbon stars and super-rich lithium stars in the galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds.},

abstract = {We revisit the evidence for the contribution of the long-lived radioactive nuclides 44Ti, 55Fe, 56Co, 57Co, and 60Co to the UVOIR light curve of SN 1987A. We show that the V-band luminosity constitutes a roughly constant fraction of the bolometric luminosity between 900 and 1900 days, and we obtain an approximate bolometric light curve out to 4334 days by scaling the late time V-band data by a constant factor where no bolometric light curve data is available. Considering the five most relevant decay chains starting at 44Ti, 55Co, 56Ni, 57Ni, and 60Co, we perform a least squares fit to the constructed composite bolometric light curve. For the nickel isotopes, we obtain best fit values of M(56Ni) = (7.1 {\textpm} 0.3) {\texttimes} 10-2 M ⊙ and M(57Ni) = (4.1 {\textpm} 1.8) {\texttimes} 10-3 M ⊙. Our best fit 44Ti mass is M(44Ti) = (0.55 {\textpm} 0.17) {\texttimes} 10-4 M ⊙, which is in disagreement with the much higher (3.1 {\textpm} 0.8) {\texttimes} 10-4 M ⊙ recently derived from INTEGRAL observations. The associated uncertainties far exceed the best fit values for 55Co and 60Co and, as a result, we only give upper limits on the production masses of M(55Co) < 7.2 {\texttimes} 10-3 M ⊙ and M(60Co) < 1.7 {\texttimes} 10-4 M ⊙. Furthermore, we find that the leptonic channels in the decay of 57Co (internal conversion and Auger electrons) are a significant contribution and constitute up to 15.5% of the total luminosity. Consideration of the kinetic energy of these electrons is essential in lowering our best fit nickel isotope production ratio to [57Ni/56Ni] = 2.5 {\textpm} 1.1, which is still somewhat high but is in agreement with gamma-ray observations and model predictions.},

abstract = {The main component of the s process is produced by low mass stars (1.5⩽M/M⩽3), when they climb for the second time the red giant branch and experience a series of He shell flashes called thermal pulses. During the relatively long period (105 yr) that elapses between two subsequent thermal pulses, a slow neutron flux is provided by the 13C($\alpha$,n)16O reaction taking place within a thin 13C pocket located in the He-rich and C-rich mantel of these stars. A second, marginal, neutron burst occurs during the thermal pulse and it is powered by the 22Ne($\alpha$,n)25Mg reaction. We review the present status of the nucleosynthesis models of low mass AGB stars. The advance in the knowledge of the complex coupling between convective mixing and nuclear process, which allows the surface enrichment of C- and s-process elements, is presented, together with the hypotheses concerning the physical mechanism driving the formation of the 13C pocket. In order to illustrate the capabilities and the limits of the theory, an updated computation of a 2M stellar structure with solar chemical composition is reported. This model has been obtained by including a full nuclear network (from H up to Bi, at the termination point of the s-process path) into the stellar evolution code. The predicted modification of the surface composition occurring during the AGB evolution is shown. The new challenge of AGB modeling, namely, the study of C-rich and s-rich very metal-poor stars, is discussed.},

abstract = {Observed chemical (anti)correlations in proton-capture elements among globular cluster stars are presently recognized as the signature of self-enrichment from now extinct, previous generations of stars. This defines the multiple population scenario. Since fluorine is also affected by proton captures, determining its abundance in globular clusters provides new and complementary clues regarding the nature of these previous generations and supplies strong observational constraints to the chemical enrichment timescales. In this paper, we present our results on near-infrared CRIRES spectroscopic observations of six cool giant stars in NGC 6656 (M22): the main objective is to derive the F content and its internal variation in this peculiar cluster, which exhibits significant changes in both light- and heavy-element abundances. Across our sample, we detected F variations beyond the measurement uncertainties and found that the F abundances are positively correlated with O and anticorrelated with Na, as expected according to the multiple population framework. Furthermore, our observations reveal an increase in the F content between the two different sub-groups, s-process rich and s-process poor, hosted within M22. The comparison with theoretical models suggests that asymptotic giant stars with masses between 4 and 5 M {\&}sun; are responsible for the observed chemical pattern, confirming evidence from previous works: the difference in age between the two sub-components in M22 must be not larger than a few hundred Myr. Based on observations taken with ESO telescopes under program 087.0319(A).},

Together with well-known physical parameters, the selected stars provide the most powerful and critical observational venues for assessing the validity of parameterized mass-loss relations for cool winds not driven by molecules or dust. In this study, star by star, we compare our previously published relation with the original Reimers relation (1975, Mem. Roy. Soc. Li{\`e}ge 6.

abstract = {We present optical and infrared (IR) observations of the TypeII SN2002hh from 3 to 397d after explosion. The optical spectroscopic (4-397d) and photometric (3-278d) data are complemented by spectroscopic (137-381d) and photometric (137-314d) data acquired at IR wavelengths. This is the first time L-band spectra have ever been successfully obtained for a supernova (SN) at a distance beyond the Local Group. The VRI light curves in the first 40d reveal SN2002hh to be an SNIIP (plateau) - the most common of all core-collapse SNe. SN2002hh is one of the most highly extinguished SNe ever investigated. To provide a match between its early-time spectrum and a coeval spectrum of the TypeIIP SN1999em, as well as maintaining consistency with KI interstellar absorption, we invoke a two-component extinction model. One component is due to the combined effect of the interstellar medium (ISM) of our Milky Way Galaxy and the SN host galaxy, while the other component is due to a `dust pocket' where the grains have a mean size smaller than in the ISM. The early-time optical light curves of SNe1999em and 2002hh are generally well matched, as are the radioactive tails of these two SNe and SN1987A. The late-time similarity of the SN2002hh optical light curves to those of SN1987A, together with measurements of the optical/IR luminosity and [FeII]1.257$\mu$m emission indicate that 0.07 +/- 0.02Msolar of 56Ni was ejected by SN2002hh. However, during the nebular phase the HKL' luminosities of SN2002hh exhibit a growing excess with respect to those of SN1987A. We attribute much of this excess to an IR-echo from a pre-existing, dusty circumstellar medium. Based on an IR-echo interpretation of the near-IR (NIR) excess, we deduce that the progenitor of SN2002hh underwent recent mass-loss of {\textasciitilde}0.3Msolar. A detailed comparison of the late-time optical and NIR spectra of SNe1987A and 2002hh is presented. While the overall impression is one of similarity between the spectra of the two events, there are notable differences. The MgI1.503$\mu$m luminosity of SN2002hh is a factor of 2.5 greater than in SN1987A at similar epochs, yet coeval silicon and calcium lines in SN2002hh are fainter. Interpreting these differences as being due to abundance variations, the overall abundance trend between SN1987A and 2002hh is not consistent with explosion model predictions. It appears that during the burning to intermediate-mass elements, the nucleosynthesis did not progress as far as might have been expected given the mass of iron ejected. Evidence for mixing in the ejecta is presented. Pronounced blueshifts seen in the more isolated lines are attributed to asymmetry in the ejecta. However, during the time-span of these observations ({\textasciitilde}1-yr post-explosion) we find no evidence of dust condensation in the ejecta such as might have been revealed by an increasing blueshift and/or attenuation of the red wings of the emission lines. Nevertheless, the clear detection of first overtone CO emission by 200d and the reddening trend in (K - L')0 suggest that dust formation in the ejecta may occur at later epochs. From the [OI] $\lambda$$\lambda$6300, 6364{\AA} doublet luminosity we infer a 16-18Msolar main-sequence progenitor star. The progenitor of SN2002hh was probably a red supergiant with a substantial, dusty wind.},

abstract = {The influence of extended convective mixing (overshoot) on asymptotic giant branch stellar evolution is investigated in detail. The extended mixing is treated time-dependently, and the efficiency declines exponentially with the geometric distance from the convective boundary. It has been considered at all convective boundaries, including the He-flash convection zone in the intershell region which forms during the thermal pulses. Both the structural and the chemical evolution are affected by the inclusion of overshoot. The main results include a very efficient third dredge-up which leads to the formation of carbon stars of low mass and luminosity. A 13C pocket which may serve as a neutron source for the s-process can form after the third dredge-up has reached into the 12C rich intershell. Overshoot applied to the pulse-driven convective zone during the He-flash leads to a deeper penetration of the bottom of this convective zone into the C/O core below the He-burning shell. This in turn causes 4He to be less abundant in the intershell while 12C and 16O are more abundant compared to calculations without overshoot. We show that overshoot at the He-flash convection zone as well as at the base of the envelope convection enhance the efficiency of the third dredge-up. Characteristic properties of the structural and chemical evolution of AGB stars are presented.},

abstract = {Strong constraints on the cosmic star formation history (SFH) have recently been established using ultraviolet and far-infrared measurements, refining the results of numerous measurements over the past decade. The data show a compellingly consistent picture of the SFH out to redshift z{\textasciitilde}6, with especially tight constraints for z<{\textasciitilde}1. We fit these data with simple analytical forms and derive conservative uncertainties. Since the z<{\textasciitilde}1 SFH data are quite precise, we investigate the sequence of assumptions and corrections that together affect the SFH normalization to test their accuracy, both in this redshift range and beyond. As lower limits on this normalization, we consider the evolution in stellar and metal mass densities, and supernova rate density, finding it unlikely that the SFH normalization is much lower than indicated by our direct fit. As a corresponding upper limit on the SFH normalization, we consider the Super-Kamiokande limit on the electron antineutrino ($\nu$e) flux from past core-collapse supernovae, which applies primarily to z<{\textasciitilde}1. We find consistency with the SFH only if the neutrino temperatures from supernova events are relatively modest. Constraints on the assumed initial mass function (IMF) also become apparent. The traditional Salpeter IMF, assumed for convenience by many authors, is known to be a poor representation at low stellar masses (<{\textasciitilde}1 Msolar), and we show that recently favored IMFs are also constrained. In particular, somewhat shallow, or top-heavy, IMFs may be preferred, although they cannot be too top-heavy. To resolve the outstanding issues, improved data are called for on the supernova rate density evolution, the ranges of stellar masses leading to core-collapse and type Ia supernovae, and the antineutrino and neutrino backgrounds from core-collapse supernovae.},

abstract = {Context. The cluster 47 Tuc is among the most metal-rich Galactic globular clusters and its metallicity is similar to that of metal-poor disc stars and open clusters. Like other globular clusters, it displays variations in the abundances of elements lighter than Si, which is generally interpreted as evidence of the presence of multiple stellar populations. Aims: We aim to determine abundances of Li, O, and Na in a sample of of 110 turn-off (TO) stars, in order to study the evolution of light elements in this cluster and to put our results in perspective with observations of other globular and open clusters, as well as with field stars. Methods: We use medium resolution spectra obtained with the GIRAFFE spectrograph at the ESO 8.2 m Kueyen VLT telescope and use state of the art 1D model atmospheres and NLTE line transfer to determine the abundances. We also employ CO5BOLD hydrodynamical simulations to assess the impact of stellar granulation on the line formation and inferred abundances. Results: Our results confirm the existence of Na-O abundance anti-correlation and hint towards a possible Li-O anti-correlation in the TO stars of 47 Tuc. At the same time, we find no convincing evidence supporting the existence of Li-Na correlation. The obtained 3D NLTE mean lithium abundance in a sample of 94 TO stars where Li lines were detected reliably, {\textlangle}A(Li)3D NLTE{\textrangle} = 1.78 {\textpm} 0.18 dex, appears to be significantly lower than what is observed in other globular clusters. At the same time, star-to-star spread in Li abundance is also larger than seen in other clusters. The highest Li abundance observed in 47 Tuc is about 0.1 dex lower than the lowest Li abundance observed among the un-depleted stars of the metal-poor open cluster NGC 2243. Conclusions: The correlations/anti-correlations among light element abundances confirm that chemical enrichment history of 47 Tuc was similar to that of other globular clusters, despite the higher metallicity of 47 Tuc. The lithium abundances in 47 Tuc, when put into context with observations in other clusters and field stars, suggest that stars that are more metal-rich than [Fe/H] {\textasciitilde} -1.0 experience significant lithium depletion during their lifetime on the main sequence, while the more metal-poor stars do not. Rather strikingly, our results suggest that initial lithium abundance with which the star was created may only depend on its age (the younger the star, the higher its Li content) and not on its metallicity.

abstract = {We have used high spatial resolution data from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and wide-field ground-based observations to search for blue straggler stars (BSSs) over the entire radial extent of the large stellar system $\omega$ Centauri. We have detected the largest population of BSSs ever observed in any stellar system. Even though the sample is restricted to the brightest portion of the BSS sequence, more than 300 candidates have been identified. BSSs are thought to be produced by the evolution of binary systems (formed either by stellar collisions or mass exchange in binary stars). Since systems like Galactic globular clusters (GGCs) and $\omega$ Cen evolve dynamically on timescales significantly shorter than their ages, binaries should have settled toward the center, showing a more concentrated radial distribution than the ordinary, less massive single stars. Indeed, in all GGCs that have been surveyed for BSSs, the BSS distribution is peaked at the center. Conversely, in $\omega$ Cen we find that the BSSs share the same radial distribution as the adopted reference populations. This is the cleanest evidence ever found that such a stellar system is not fully relaxed even in the central region. We further argue that the absence of central concentration in the BSS distribution rules out a collisional origin. Thus, the $\omega$ Cen BSSs are the purest and largest population of noncollisional BSSs ever observed. Our results allow the first empirical quantitative estimate of the production rate of BSSs via this channel. BSSs in $\omega$ Cen may represent the best local template for modeling the BSS populations in distant galaxies where they cannot be individually observed.

abstract = {Context: We test the effect of proton-capture reaction rate uncertainties on the abundances of the Ne, Na, Mg and Al isotopes processed by the NeNa and MgAl chains during hot bottom burning (HBB) in asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars of intermediate mass between 4 and 6 M⊙ and metallicities between Z = 0.0001 and 0.02. Aims: We provide uncertainty ranges for the AGB stellar yields, for inclusion in galactic chemical evolution models, and indicate which reaction rates are most important and should be better determined. Methods: We use a fast synthetic algorithm based on detailed AGB models. We run a large number of stellar models, varying one reaction per time for a very fine grid of values, as well as all reactions simultaneously. Results: We show that there are uncertainties in the yields of all the Ne, Na, Mg and Al isotopes due to uncertain proton-capture reaction rates. The most uncertain yields are those of 26Al and 23Na (variations of two orders of magnitude), 24Mg and 27Al (variations of more than one order of magnitude), 20Ne and 22Ne (variations between factors 2 and 7). In order to obtain more reliable Ne, Na, Mg and Al yields from IM-AGB stars the rates that require more accurate determination are: 22Ne(p,$\gamma$)23Na, 23Na(p,$\gamma$)24Mg, 25Mg(p,$\gamma$)26Al, 26Mg(p,$\gamma$)27Al and 26Al(p,$\gamma$)27Si. Conclusions: Detailed galactic chemical evolution models should be constructed to address the impact of our uncertainty ranges on the observational constraints related to HBB nucleosynthesis, such as globular cluster chemical anomalies.

Here, we use data for the Sun to derive an empirical correction for the near-surface offset, which we then apply to three other stars ($\alpha$ Cen A, $\alpha$ Cen B, and $\beta$ Hyi).

abstract = {We study the formation and dynamical evolution of clusters with multiple stellar generations. Observational studies have found that some globular clusters host a population of second generation (SG) stars which show chemical anomalies and must have formed from gas containing matter processed in the envelopes of first generation (FG) cluster stars. We study the SG formation process by means of one-dimensional (1D) hydrodynamical simulations, starting from a FG already in place and assuming that the SG is formed by the gas ejected by the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. This gas collects in a cooling flow into the cluster core, where it forms SG stars. The SG subsystem emerging from this process is initially strongly concentrated in the cluster innermost regions and its structural properties are largely independent of the FG initial properties. We also present the results of a model in which pristine gas contributes to the SG formation. In this model a very helium-rich SG population and one with a moderate helium enrichment form; the resulting SG bimodal helium distribution resembles that observed for SG stars in NGC2808. By means of N-body simulations, we then study the two-population cluster dynamical evolution and mass loss. In our simulations, a large fraction of FG stars are lost early in the cluster evolution due to the expansion and stripping of the cluster outer layers resulting from early mass loss associated with FG supernova (SN) ejecta. The SG population, initially concentrated in the innermost cluster regions, is largely unscathed by this early mass loss, and this early evolution leads to values of the number ratio of SG to FG stars consistent with observations. We also demonstrate possible evolutionary routes leading to the loss of most of the FG population, leaving an SG-dominated cluster. As the cluster evolves and the two populations mix, the local ratio of SG to FG stars, initially a decreasing function of radius, tends to a constant value in the inner parts of the cluster. Until mixing is complete, the radial profile of this number ratio is characterized by a flat inner part and a declining portion in the outer cluster regions.},

This corroborates an earlier suggestion that H 1504+65 represents a naked C/O stellar core or even the C/O envelope of an O-Ne-Mg white dwarf.

abstract = {Aims: The main aim of the present work is to derive an empirical mass-loss (ML) law for Population II stars in first and second ascent red giant branches. Methods: We used the Spitzer InfraRed Array Camera (IRAC) photometry obtained in the 3.6-8 $\mu$m range of a carefully chosen sample of 15 Galactic globular clusters spanning the entire metallicity range and sampling the vast zoology of horizontal branch (HB) morphologies. We complemented the IRAC photometry with near-infrared data to build suitable color-magnitude and color-color diagrams and identify mass-losing giant stars. Results: We find that while the majority of stars show colors typical of cool giants, some stars show an excess of mid-infrared light that is larger than expected from their photospheric emission and that is plausibly due to dust formation in mass flowing from them. For these stars, we estimate dust and total (gas + dust) ML rates and timescales. We finally calibrate an empirical ML law for Population II red and asymptotic giant branch stars with varying metallicity. We find that at a given red giant branch luminosity only a fraction of the stars are losing mass. From this, we conclude that ML is episodic and is active only a fraction of the time, which we define as the duty cycle. The fraction of mass-losing stars increases by increasing the stellar luminosity and metallicity. The ML rate, as estimated from reasonable assumptions for the gas-to-dust ratio and expansion velocity, depends on metallicity and slowly increases with decreasing metallicity. In contrast, the duty cycle increases with increasing metallicity, with the net result that total ML increases moderately with increasing metallicity, about 0.1 M⊙ every dex in [Fe/H]. For Population II asymptotic giant branch stars, we estimate a total ML of $\le$0.1 M⊙, nearly constant with varying metallicity.

abstract = {Contrary to historical expectation, stars within a given globular cluster often exhibit wide variations in the abundance of C, N, and O as well as certain light metals, particularly Na and Al. Owing to flux limitations, studies have been confined to evolved stars, especially giants, but in few instances variations have been detected among main-sequence stars. Among giants, the variations are of two kinds. The abundances of C and N are often anticorrelated, and in the limited number of cases in which both have been measured, O and N abundances have also often proved to be anticorrelated (Pilachowski 1988; Sneden et al. 1991; Brown et al. 1991; Kraft et al. 1992). Following pioneering work by Cohen (1978) and Peterson (1980), strong evidence has recently emerged for the existence of a significant global anticorrelation between O and Na abundances (Drake et al. 1992, Kraft et al. 1993). The observations are discussed in terms of contrasting hypotheses: evolutionary versus primordial. In the former, the variations are attributed to the dredgeup of material that has been processed through the CNO cycle in the globular-cluster stars themselves. In the latter, the variations are attributed to primordial chemical inhomogeneities in the material out of which the cluster stars were formed, the composition of these 'clumps' having been determined by nuclear processing in a prior generation of more massive stars. Observational evidence supporting each of these scenarios is cited. Recent studies of stellar rotation among horizontal branch stars in certain clusters (Peterson et al. 1994) as well as new calculations of Na-23 and Al-27 production in the CNO processing regions of evolving low-mass giants (Langer et al. 1993) lend fresh support to the evolutionary hypothesis. However, such calculations do not explain the variation of C and N abundances found among cluster main-sequence stars (Suntzeff 1989; Briley et al. 1991) which therefore seem explicable only on the basis of a primordial scenario. Among mildly metal-poor giants, i.e., those in the range from solar metallicity to (Fe/H) approximately -1, recent observational evidence suggesting the existence of a substructure in the (el/Fe) ratios of the heavier alpha elements, e.g., Si, Mg, Ca, and Ti, is discussed. The possible influence of this effect on the interpretation of the integrated spectra of extragalactic globular clusters and E galaxies is noted.},

abstract = {We present a chemical composition analysis of 36 giant stars in the mildly metal-poor (<[Fe/H]>=-1.21) globular cluster M5 (NGC 5904). The analysis makes use of high-resolution data acquired for 25 stars at the Keck I telescope, as well as a reanalysis of the high-resolution spectra for 13 stars acquired for an earlier study at Lick Observatory. We employed two analysis techniques: (1) adopting standard spectroscopic constraints, including setting the surface gravity from the ionization equilibrium of iron, and (2) subsequent to investigating alternative approaches, adopting an analysis consistent with the non-LTE precepts as recently described by Th{\'e}venin {\&} Idiart. The abundance ratios we derive for magnesium, silicon, calcium, scandium, titanium, vanadium, nickel, barium, and europium in M5 show no significant abundance variations, and the ratios are comparable to those of halo field stars. However, large variations are seen in the abundances of oxygen, sodium, and aluminum, the elements that are sensitive to proton-capture nucleosynthesis. These variations are well-correlated with the CN band strength index S(3839). Surprisingly, in M5 the dependence of the abundance variations on logg is in the opposite sense to that discovered in M13 by the Lick-Texas group where the relationship provided strong evidence in support of the evolutionary scenario. The present analysis of M5 giants does not necessarily rule out an evolutionary scenario, but it provides no support for it either. In comparing the abundances of M5 and M4 (NGC 6121), another mildly metal-poor (<[Fe/H]>=-1.08) globular cluster, we find that silicon, aluminum, barium, and lanthanum are overabundant in M4 with respect to that seen in M5, confirming and expanding the results of previous studies. In comparing the abundances between these two clusters and others having comparable metallicities, we find that the anticorrelations observed in M5 are similar to those found in more metal-poor clusters, M3, M10, and M13 (<[Fe/H]>=-1.5 to -1.6), whereas the behavior in M4 is more like that of the more metal-rich globular cluster M71 (<[Fe/H]>{\textasciitilde}-0.8). We conclude that among stars in Galactic globular clusters there is no definitive ``single'' value of [X/Fe] at a given [Fe/H] for at least some $\alpha$-capture, odd-Z, and slow neutron-capture process elements, in this case, silicon, aluminum, barium, and lanthanum.

abstract = {Star clusters are known to have smaller intrinsic metallicity spreads than dwarf galaxies due to their shorter star formation timescales. Here we use individual spectroscopic [Fe/H] measurements of stars in 19 Local Group dwarf galaxies, 13 Galactic open clusters, and 49 globular clusters to show that star cluster and dwarf galaxy linear metallicity distributions are binomial in form, with all objects showing strong correlations between their mean linear metallicity \bar{Z} and intrinsic spread in metallicity $\sigma$(Z)2. A plot of $\sigma$(Z)2 versus \bar{Z} shows that the correlated relationships are offset for the dwarf galaxies from the star clusters. The common binomial nature of these linear metallicity distributions can be explained with a simple inhomogeneous chemical evolution model, where the star cluster and dwarf galaxy behavior in the \sigma (Z)^{2}-\bar{Z} diagram is reproduced in terms of the number of enrichment events, covering fraction, and intrinsic size of the enriched regions. The inhomogeneity of the self-enrichment sets the slope for the observed dwarf galaxy \sigma (Z)^{2}-\bar{Z} correlation. The offset of the star cluster sequence from that of the dwarf galaxies is due to pre-enrichment, and the slope of the star cluster sequence represents the remnant signature of the self-enriched history of their host galaxies. The offset can be used to separate star clusters from dwarf galaxies without a priori knowledge of their luminosity or dynamical mass. The application of the inhomogeneous model to the \sigma (Z)^{2}-\bar{Z} relationship provides a numerical formalism to connect the self-enrichment and pre-enrichment between star clusters and dwarf galaxies using physically motivated chemical enrichment parameters. Therefore we suggest that the \sigma (Z)^{2}-\bar{Z} relationship can provide insight into what drives the efficiency of star formation and chemical evolution in galaxies, and is an important prediction for galaxy simulation models to reproduce.},

abstract = {Recently, high-dispersion spectroscopy has demonstrated conclusively that four of the five globular clusters (GCs) in the Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy are very metal-poor with [Fe/H] < -2. The remaining cluster, Fornax 4, has [Fe/H] = -1.4. This is in stark contrast to the field star metallicity distribution which shows a broad peak around [Fe/H] $\approx$ -1 with only a few percent of the stars having [Fe/H] < -2. If we only consider stars and clusters with [Fe/H] < -2 we thus find an extremely high GC specific frequency, SN $\approx$ 400, implying by far the highest ratio of GCs to field stars known anywhere. We estimate that about 1/5-1/4 of all stars in the Fornax dSph with [Fe/H] < -2 belong to the four most metal-poor GCs. These GCs could, therefore, at most have been a factor of 4-5 more massive initially. Yet, the Fornax GCs appear to share the same anomalous chemical abundance patterns known from Milky Way GCs, commonly attributed to the presence of multiple stellar generations within the clusters. The extreme ratio of metal-poor GC- versus field stars in the Fornax dSph is difficult to reconcile with scenarios for self-enrichment and early evolution of GCs in which a large fraction (90%-95%) of the first-generation stars have been lost. It also suggests that the GCs may not have formed as part of a larger population of now disrupted clusters with an initial power-law mass distribution. The Fornax dSph may be a rosetta stone for constraining theories of the formation, self-enrichment and early dynamical evolution of star clusters.

Most simulations so far considered only one spatial octant and assumed mirror symmetry to the other octants. Two full-star models are evolved to homologous expansion and compared with previous single-octant simulations. Therefrom we analyze the effect of abolishing the artificial symmetry constraint on the evolution of the flame surface. It turns out that the development of asymmetries depends on the chosen initial flame configuration. Such asymmetries of the explosion process could possibly contribute to the observed polarization of some type Ia supernova spectra.},

abstract = {Stars are rotating and magnetic bodies. Moreover, more and more constraints are obtained on such dynamical processes using, for example, seismology and spectropolarimetry. Therefore, it is now necessary to get a complete and coherent picture of dynamical processes in stellar interiors. However, to simulate such processes in a star in full details would require treating length scales and time scales spanning many orders of magnitude. This is clearly not feasible, even with the most powerful computers available today. This is the reason why it is nowadays necessary to use and couple 1-D, 2-D, and 3-D modelings to get a global picture of macroscopic MHD transport processes in stellar interiors. In this review, we report the state of the art of the modeling of transport processes in stellar interiors (both in radiation and in convection zones) aimed to study the stars angular momentum history, the related profile of differential rotation, and their magnetism.},

abstract = {Realistic 3-dimensional (3D), radiative hydrodynamical surface convection simulations of the metal-poor halo stars HD 140283 and HD 84937 have been performed. Due to the dominance of adiabatic cooling over radiative heating very low atmospheric temperatures are encountered. The lack of spectral lines in these metal-poor stars thus causes much steeper temperature gradients than in classical 1D hydrostatic model atmospheres where the temperature of the optically thin layers is determined by radiative equilibrium. The modified atmospheric structures cause changes in the emergent stellar spectra. In particular, the primordial Li abundances may have been overestimated by 0.2-0.35 dex with 1D model atmospheres. However, we caution that our result assumes local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE), while the steep temperature gradients may be prone to e.g. over-ionization.},

abstract = {After the big bang nucleosynthesis, the first heavy element enrichment in the universe was made by a supernova (SN) explosion of a population (Pop) III star (Pop III SN). The abundance ratios of elements produced from Pop III SNe are recorded in abundance patterns of extremely metal-poor (EMP) stars. The observations of the increasing number of EMP stars have made it possible to statistically constrain the explosion properties of Pop III SNe. We present Pop III SN models whose nucleosynthesis yields well reproduce, individually, the abundance patterns of 48 such metal-poor stars as [Fe/H] <{\textasciitilde} - 3.5. We then derive relations between the abundance ratios of EMP stars and certain explosion properties of Pop III SNe: the higher [(C + N)/Fe] and [(C + N)/Mg] ratios correspond to the smaller ejected Fe mass and the larger compact remnant mass, respectively. Using these relations, the distributions of the abundance ratios of EMP stars are converted to those of the explosion properties of Pop III SNe. Such distributions are compared with those of the explosion properties of present day SNe: the distribution of the ejected Fe mass of Pop III SNe has the same peak as that of the present day SNe but shows an extended tail down to {\textasciitilde}10-2-10-5 M ⊙, and the distribution of the mass of the compact remnant of Pop III SNe is as wide as that of the present-day, stellar-mass black holes. Our results demonstrate the importance of large samples of EMP stars obtained by ongoing and future EMP star surveys and subsequent high-dispersion spectroscopic observations in clarifying the nature of Pop III SNe in the early universe.},

These species and the initially present 24Mg are depleted by hot bottom burning (HBB) during the interpulse phase. As a result, 23Na, 25Mg, and 26Mg are enhanced. If the HBB temperatures are sufficiently high for this process to deplete oxygen efficiently, 23Na is first produced and then depleted during the interpulse phase. Although the simultaneous depletion of 16O and enhancement of 23Na is possible, the required fine-tuning of the dredge-up and HBB casts some doubt on the robustness of this process as the origin of the O-Na anticorrelation observed in globular cluster stars. However, a very robust prediction of our models are low 24Mg/25Mg and 24Mg/26Mg ratios whenever significant 16O depletion can be achieved. This seems to be in stark contrast to recent observations of the magnesium isotopic ratios in the globular cluster NGC 6752.},

Spectra of seven members were taken using the UVES spectrograph at the ESO VLT2 and the multiobject FLAMES facility. We exclude any intrinsic metallicity spread in this cluster: on average, [Fe/H]=-0.44{\textpm}0.01{\textpm}0.03 dex on the scale of the present series of papers, where the first error bar refers to individual star-to-star errors and the second is systematic, relative to the cluster. Elements involved in H-burning at high temperatures show large spreads, exceeding the estimated errors in the analysis. In particular, the pairs Na and O, Al and Mg are anticorrelated and Na and Al are correlated among the giants in NGC 6388, the typical pattern observed in all galactic globular clusters studied so far. Stars in NGC 6388 shows an excess of $\alpha$-process elements, similar to the one found in the twin bulge cluster NGC 6441. Mn is found underabundant in NGC 6388, in agreement with the average abundance ratio shown by clusters of any metallicity. Abundances of neutron-capture elements are homogeneously distributed within NGC 6388; the [Eu/Fe] ratio stands above the value found in field stars of similar metallicity.

abstract = {Context. The chemical compositions of globular clusters provide important information on the star formation that occurred at very early times in the Galaxy. In particular the abundance patterns of elements with atomic number z $\le$ 13 may shed light on the properties of stars that early on enriched parts of the star-forming gas with the rest-products of hydrogen-burning at high temperatures. Aims: We analyse and discuss the chemical compositions of a large number of elements in 21 red giant branch stars in the metal-poor globular cluster NGC 6397. We compare the derived abundance patterns with theoretical predictions in the framework of the "wind of fast rotating massive star"-scenario. Methods: High-resolution spectra were obtained with the FLAMES/UVES spectrograph on the VLT. We determined non-LTE abundances of Na, and LTE abundances for the remaining 21 elements, including O (from the [OI] line at 630 nm), Mg, Al, $\alpha$, iron-peak, and neutron-capture elements, many of which had not been previously analysed for this cluster. We also considered the influence of possible He enrichment in the analysis of stellar spectra. Results: We find that the Na abundances of evolved, as well as unevolved, stars in NGC 6397 show a distinct bimodality, which is indicative of two stellar populations: one primordial stellar generation of composition similar to field stars, and a second generation that is polluted with material processed during hydrogen-burning, i.e., enriched in Na and Al and depleted in O and Mg. The red giant branch exhibits a similar bimodal distribution in the Str{\"o}mgren colour index cy = c1 - (b - y), implying that there are also large differences in the N abundance. The two populations have the same composition for all analysed elements heavier than Al, within the measurement uncertainty of the analysis, with the possible exception of [Y/Fe]. Using two stars with almost identical stellar parameters, one from each generation, we estimate the difference in He content, $\Delta$Y = 0.01 {\textpm} 0.06, given the assumption that the mass fraction of iron is the same for the stars. Conclusions: NGC 6397 hosts two stellar populations that have different chemical compositions of N, O, Na, Mg, and probably Al. The cluster is dominated (75%) by the second generation. We show that massive stars of the first generation can be held responsible for the abundance patterns observed in the second generation long-lived stars of NGC 6397. We estimate that the initial mass of this globular cluster is at least ten times higher than its present-day value.

abstract = {We consider the horizontal branch (HB) of the globular cluster Terzan 5, recently shown to be split into two parts, the fainter one ($\delta$MK {\textasciitilde} 0.3 mag) having a lower metallicity than the more luminous. Both features show that it contains at least two stellar populations. The separation in magnitude has been ascribed to an age difference of {\textasciitilde}6 Gyr and interpreted as the result of an atypical evolutionary history for this cluster. We show that the observed HB morphology is also consistent with a model in which the bright HB is composed of second generation stars that are metal enriched and with a helium mass fraction larger (by $\delta$Y {\textasciitilde} 0.07) than that of first generation stars populating the fainter part of the HB. Terzan 5 would therefore be anomalous, compared to most "normal" clusters hosting multiple populations, only because its second generation is strongly contaminated by supernova ejecta; the previously proposed prolonged period of star formation, however, is not required. The iron enrichment of the bright HB can be ascribed either to contamination from Type Ia supernova ejecta of the low-iron, helium-rich, ejecta of the massive asymptotic giant branch stars of the cluster, or to its mixing with gas, accreting on the cluster from the environment, that has been subject to fast metal enrichment due to its proximity with the galactic bulge. The model proposed here requires only a small age difference of {\textasciitilde}100 Myr.},

abstract = {Near-infrared spectra of 21 giants in $\omega$ Cen spanning the whole range of metallicities observed in this cluster are presented. This work is part of a coordinated photometric and spectroscopic campaign in the optical and the infrared, aimed at studying the complex stellar population of $\omega$ Cen and understanding its formation and chemical evolution. By analyzing the several CO and OH molecular bands and atomic lines in the spectra of the selected giants, metal abundances and abundance ratios have been obtained. The existence of three major metallicity regimes at [Fe/H] $\approx$ -1.6 and -1.2 and [Fe/H] $\le$ -0.5 has been confirmed. The most metal-rich stars in our sample show a lower (if any) $\alpha$ enhancement when compared with the more metal-poor components, suggesting that they should have formed in a medium significantly polluted by Type Ia supernova ejecta. Isotopic carbon abundances have been also inferred, providing an average 12C/13C 4, which clearly indicates that extra-mixing processes occurred in the stellar interiors during the ascent on the red giant branch.},

abstract = {It has recently been suggested that the presence of multiple populations showing various amounts of helium enhancement is the rule, rather than the exception, among globular star clusters. An important prediction of this helium enhancement scenario is that the helium-enhanced blue horizontal branch (HB) stars should be brighter than the red HB stars which are not helium enhanced. In this Letter, we test this prediction in the case of the Galactic globular cluster M3 (NGC 5272), for which the helium-enhancement scenario predicts helium enhancements of gsim0.02 in virtually all blue HB stars. Using high-precision Str{\"o}mgren photometry and spectroscopic gravities for blue HB stars, we find that any helium enhancement among most of the cluster's blue HB stars is very likely less than 0.01, thus ruling out the much higher helium enhancements that have been proposed in the literature.

abstract = {WASP-19b is one of the most irradiated hot-Jupiters known. Its secondary eclipse is the deepest of all transiting planets and has been measured in multiple optical and infrared bands. We obtained a z-band eclipse observation with a measured depth of 0.080% {\textpm} 0.029%, using the 2 m Faulkes Telescope South, which is consistent with the results of previous observations. We combined our measurement of the z-band eclipse with previous observations to explore atmosphere models of WASP-19b that are consistent with its broadband spectrum. We use the VSTAR radiative transfer code to examine the effect of varying pressure-temperature profiles and C/O abundance ratios on the emission spectrum of the planet. We find that models with super-solar carbon enrichment best match the observations, which is consistent with previous model retrieval studies. We also include upper atmosphere haze as another dimension in the interpretation of exoplanet emission spectra and find that particles <0.5 $\mu$m in size are unlikely to be present in WASP-19b.},

abstract = {We present some illustrative models of cosmic chemical evolution and compare them with the observed abundances of neutral hydrogen, heavy elements, and dust in damped Lyman$\alpha$ systems. To allow for a wide range of possibilities, we consider closed-box, inflow, and outflow models. The novel feature of our models is a self-consistent correction for the absorbers that are missing from existing samples as a result of the obscuration of background quasars. This is accomplished by assuming that the dust-to-gas ratio is proportional to the mean metallicity in the absorbers. Our models reproduce all of the available data on damped Lyman$\alpha$ systems, including the mean metallicity Z ≍ 0.1 Zsun at z ≍ 2.2, without any fine tuning of the input parameters. The models are also consistent with the average properties of present-day galaxies. The rapid rise in the mean metallicity with decreasing redshift is caused by high rates of star formation at 1 ≲ z ≲ 2. In contrast, models without obscuration have less star formation at these redshifts and fail to match the mean metallicity in the damped Lyman$\alpha$ systems.},

The length scales pertinent to the initiation of the detonation are notoriously unresolved in multidimensional stellar simulations, prompting the use of results of one-dimensional simulations at higher resolution, such as those performed for this work, as guidelines for deciding whether or not conditions reached in the higher dimensional full star simulations successfully would lead to the onset of a detonation. Spontaneous initiation relies on the existence of a suitable gradient in self-ignition (induction) times of the fuel, which we set up with a spatially localized nonuniformity of temperature{\textemdash}a hot spot. We determine the critical (smallest) sizes of such hot spots that still marginally result in a detonation in WD matter by integrating the reactive Euler equations with the hydrodynamics code FLASH. We quantify the dependences of the critical sizes of such hot spots on composition, background temperature, peak temperature, geometry, and functional form of the temperature disturbance, many of which were hitherto largely unexplored in the literature. We discuss the implications of our results in the context of modeling of SNe Ia.},

abstract = {We present the results of a large-scale survey of neutron(n)-capture elements in Galactic planetary nebulae (PNe), undertaken to study enrichments from s-process nucleosynthesis in their progenitor stars. From new K-band observations of over 100 PNe supplemented by data from the literature, we have detected the emission lines [Kr III] 2.199 $\mu$m and/or [Se IV] 2.287 $\mu$m in 81 of 120 objects. We determine Se and Kr elemental abundances, employing ionization correction formulae derived in the first paper of this series. We find a significant range in Se and Kr abundances, from near solar (no enrichment) to enhanced by >1.0 dex relative to solar, which we interpret as self-enrichment due to in situ s-process nucleosynthesis. Kr tends to be more strongly enriched than Se; in 18 objects exhibiting both Se and Kr emission, we find that [Kr/Se]=0.5+/-0.2. Our survey has increased the number of PNe with n-capture element abundance determinations by a factor of 10, enabling us for the first time to search for correlations with other nebular properties. As expected, we find a positive correlation between s-process enrichments and the C/O ratio. Type I and bipolar PNe, which arise from intermediate-mass progenitors (>3-4 Msolar), exhibit little to no s-process enrichments. Finally, PNe with H-deficient Wolf-Rayet central stars do not exhibit systematically larger s-process enrichments than objects with H-rich nuclei. Overall, 44% of the PNe in our sample display significant s-process enrichments (>0.3 dex). Using an empirical PN luminosity function to correct for incompleteness, we estimate that the true fraction of s-process enriched Galactic PNe is at least 20%. This paper includes data taken at the McDonald Observatory of the University of Texas at Austin.},

We will discuss the importance of state of the art observations and modelling in the quest to determine precise values of the primordial abundance of D and 4He, using observations of astrophysical objects and modern day atomic parameters.

abstract = {The collapse and fragmentation of filamentary primordial gas clouds are explored using one- and two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations coupled with the nonequilibrium processes of hydrogen molecule formation. The cloud evolution is computed from the initial central density nc=10-106 cm-3. The simulations show that depending on the initial density, there are two occasions for the fragmentation of primordial filaments. If a filament has relatively low initial density such as nc<{\textasciitilde}105 cm-3, the radial contraction is slow as a result of less effective H2 cooling and appreciably decelerates at densities higher than a critical density, where LTE populations are achieved for the rotational levels of H2 molecules and the cooling timescale becomes accordingly longer than the free-fall timescale. This filament tends to fragment into dense clumps before the central density reaches 108-109 cm-3, where H2 cooling by three-body reactions is effective and the fragment mass is more massive than some tens of Msolar. In contrast, if a filament is initially as dense as nc>{\textasciitilde}105 cm-3, the more effective H2 cooling with the help of three-body reactions allows the filament to contract up to n{\textasciitilde}1012 cm-3. After the density reaches n{\textasciitilde}1012 cm-3, the filament becomes optically thick to H2 lines and the radial contraction subsequently almost stops. At this final hydrostatic stage, the fragment mass is lowered down to {\textasciitilde}1 Msolar because of the high density of the filament. The dependence of the fragment mass upon the initial density could be translated into the dependence on the local amplitude of random Gaussian density fields or the epoch of the collapse of a parent cloud. Hence, it is predicted that the initial mass function of Population III stars is likely to be bimodal with peaks of {\textasciitilde}102 and {\textasciitilde}1 Msolar, where the relative heights could be a function of the collapse epoch. Implications for the metal enrichment by Population III stars at high redshifts and baryonic dark matter are briefly discussed.},

abstract = {This article first reviews the basic physics of rotating stars and their evolution. The changes of the mechanical and thermal equilibrium of rotating stars are examined. An important, predicted and observed, effect is that rotating stars are hotter at the poles and cooler at the equator. The mass loss by stellar winds, which are influenced by the anisotropic temperature distribution, is discussed. These anisotropies in the interior are also driving circulation currents, which transports the chemical elements and the angular momentum in stars. Internal differential rotation, if present, creates instabilities and mixing, in particular, the shear mixing, the horizontal turbulence and their interactions. A major check of the model predictions concerns the changes of the surface abundances, which are modified by mass loss in the very massive stars and by rotational mixing in O-type and B-type stars. The observations are shown to confirm the existence of rotational mixing, with much larger effects at lower metallicities. The predictions of stellar models concerning the evolution of the surface velocities, the evolutionary tracks in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram and lifetimes, the populations of blue, red supergiants and Wolf-Rayet stars, and the progenitors of type Ibc supernovae are discussed. In many aspects, rotating models are shown to provide a much better fit than nonrotating ones. Using the same physical ingredients as those which fit the best observations of stars at near solar metallicities, the consequences of rotating models for the status of Be stars, the progenitors of gamma ray bursts, the evolution of Pop III stars and of very metal-poor stars, the early chemical evolution of galaxies, the origin of the C-enhanced metal poor stars and of the chemical anomalies in globular clusters are explored. Rotation together with mass loss are two key physical ingredients shaping the evolution of massive stars during the whole cosmic history.},

We report on methods to achieve this in our current implementation of multi-dimensional type Ia supernova explosion models. The novel scheme is thoroughly tested in two dimensions and a simple example of a three-dimensional simulation is presented. We discuss to what degree the assumption of homologous expansion is justified in these models.},

abstract = {The last seven years have seen an explosion in the number of Integral Field galaxy surveys, obtaining resolved 2D spectroscopy, especially at high-redshift. These have taken advantage of the mature capabilities of 8-10 m class telescopes and the development of associated technology such as AO. Surveys have leveraged both high spectroscopic resolution enabling internal velocity measurements and high spatial resolution from AO techniques and sites with excellent natural seeing. For the first time, we have been able to glimpse the kinematic state of matter in young, assembling star-forming galaxies and learn detailed astrophysical information about the physical processes and compare their kinematic scaling relations with those in the local Universe. Observers have measured disc galaxy rotation, merger signatures, and turbulence-enhanced velocity dispersions of gas-rich discs. Theorists have interpreted kinematic signatures of galaxies in a variety of ways (rotation, merging, outflows, and feedback) and attempted to discuss evolution vs. theoretical models and relate it to the evolution in galaxy morphology. A key point that has emerged from this activity is that substantial fractions of high-redshift galaxies have regular kinematic morphologies despite irregular photometric morphologies and this is likely due to the presence of a large number of highly gas-rich discs. There has not yet been a review of this burgeoning topic. In this first Dawes review, I will discuss the extensive kinematic surveys that have been done and the physical models that have arisen for young galaxies at high-redshift.},

abstract = {We present TARDIS - an open-source code for rapid spectral modelling of supernovae (SNe). Our goal is to develop a tool that is sufficiently fast to allow exploration of the complex parameter spaces of models for SN ejecta. This can be used to analyse the growing number of high-quality SN spectra being obtained by transient surveys. The code uses Monte Carlo methods to obtain a self-consistent description of the plasma state and to compute a synthetic spectrum. It has a modular design to facilitate the implementation of a range of physical approximations that can be compared to assess both accuracy and computational expediency. This will allow users to choose a level of sophistication appropriate for their application. Here, we describe the operation of the code and make comparisons with alternative radiative transfer codes of differing levels of complexity (SYN++, PYTHON and ARTIS). We then explore the consequence of adopting simple prescriptions for the calculation of atomic excitation, focusing on four species of relevance to Type Ia SN spectra - Si II, S II, Mg II and Ca II. We also investigate the influence of three methods for treating line interactions on our synthetic spectra and the need for accurate radiative rate estimates in our scheme.},

abstract = {We study the late evolution of solar metallicity stars in the transition region between white dwarf formation and core collapse. This includes the super-asymptotic giant branch (super-AGB, SAGB) stars, which ignite carbon burning and form an oxygen-neon (ONe) core. SAGB star cores may grow to the Chandrasekhar mass because of continued H- and He-shell burning, ending as core-collapse supernovae. From stellar evolution models we find that the initial mass range for SAGB evolution is 7.5-9.25 Msolar. We perform calculations with three different stellar evolution codes to judge the robustness of our results. The mass range significantly depends on the treatment of semiconvective mixing and convective overshooting. To consider the effect of a large number of thermal pulses, as expected in SAGB stars, we construct synthetic SAGB models that are calibrated through stellar evolution simulations. The synthetic model enables us to compute the evolution of the main properties of SAGB stars from the onset of thermal pulses until the core reaches the Chandrasekhar mass or is uncovered by the stellar wind. Thereby, we differentiate the stellar initial mass ranges that produce ONe WDs from that leading to electron-capture SNe. The latter is found to be 9.0-9.25 Msolar for our fiducial model, implying that electron-capture SNe would constitute about 4% of all SNe in the local universe. The error in this determination due to uncertainties in the third dredge-up efficiency and AGB mass-loss rate could lead to about a doubling of the number of electron-capture SNe, which provides a firm upper limit to their contribution to all supernovae of {\textasciitilde}20%.},

abstract = {We present a metallicity distribution based on photometry and spectra for 442 $\omega$ Centauri cluster members that lie at the main-sequence turnoff region of the color-magnitude diagram. This distribution is similar to that found for the red giant branch. The distribution shows a sharp rise to a mean of [Fe/H]=-1.7 with a long tail to higher metallicities. Ages have then been determined for the stars using theoretical isochrones enabling the construction of an age-metallicity diagram. Interpretation of this diagram is complicated by the correlation of the errors in the metallicities and ages. Nevertheless, after extensive Monte Carlo simulations, we conclude that our data show that the formation of the cluster took place over an extended period of time: the most metal-rich stars in our sample ([Fe/H]{\textasciitilde}-0.6) are younger by 2-4 Gyr than the most metal-poor population.},

The heavy elements can be used as tracers of the nucleosynthetic events that defined the formation and evolution of star clusters in the early Universe. In particular, the chemical evolution model focuses on the hypothesis that rapidly-rotating massive stars produced the heavy elements via the slow neutron-capture process and seeded the proto-cluster while the stars we see today were still forming. We compare our model with heavy element abundances in M4 and M5, and M22. Our results are strongly dependent on the highly uncertain rate of the 17O($\alpha$,$\gamma$)21Ne reaction, which determines the strength of 16O as a neutron poison. We find that the [Pb/Ba] ratio is too low to match the empirical value, which might suggest that a contribution from AGB stars is required.},

To demonstrate the capabilities of the code, we investigate potential progenitors for the Type IIb Supernova 1993J, which is believed to have been an interacting binary system prior to its primary exploding. We use our detailed binary stellar evolution code to model this system to determine the possible range of primary and secondary masses that could have produced the observed characteristics of this system, with particular reference to the secondary. Using the luminosities and temperatures for both stars (as determined by Maund et al.) and the remaining mass of the hydrogen envelope of the primary at the time of explosion, we find that if mass transfer is 100 per cent efficient, the observations can be reproduced by a system consisting of a 15Msolar primary and a 14Msolar secondary in an orbit with an initial period of 2100 days. With a mass transfer efficiency of 50 per cent, a more massive system consisting of a 17Msolar primary and a 16Msolar secondary in an initial orbit of 2360 days is needed. We also investigate some of the uncertainties in the evolution, including the effects of tidal interaction, convective overshooting and thermohaline mixing.},

abstract = {We obtained FLAMES GIRAFFE+UVES spectra for both first- and second-generation red giant branch (RGB) stars in the globular cluster (GC) NGC 362 and used them to derive abundances of 21 atomic species for a sample of 92 stars. The surveyed elements include proton-capture (O, Na, Mg, Al, Si), $\alpha$-capture (Ca, Ti), Fe-peak (Sc, V, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu), and neutron-capture elements (Y, Zr, Ba, La, Ce, Nd, Eu, Dy). The analysis is fully consistent with that presented for twenty GCs in previous papers of this series. Stars in NGC 362 seem to be clustered into two discrete groups along the Na-O anti-correlation with a gap at [O/Na] {\textasciitilde} 0 dex. Na-rich, second generation stars show a trend to be more centrally concentrated, although the level of confidence is not very high. When compared to the classical second-parameter twin NGC 288 with similar metallicity but different horizontal branch type and a much lower total mass, the proton-capture processing in stars of NGC 362 seems to be more extreme, confirming previous analysis. We discovered the presence of a secondary RGB sequence, which is redder than the bulk of the RGB. A preliminary estimate shows that this sequence comprises about 6% of RGB stars. Our spectroscopic data and literature photometry indicate that this sequence is populated almost exclusively by giants rich in Ba and is probably rich in all s-process elements, as found in other clusters. In this regard, NGC 362 joins previously studied GCs like NGC 1851, NGC 6656 (M 22), and NGC 7089 (M 2).

abstract = {We present the first ever direct N-body computations of an old Milky Way globular cluster over its entire lifetime on a star-by-star basis. Using recent GPU hardware at Bonn University, we have performed a comprehensive set of N-body calculations to model the distant outer halo globular cluster Palomar 14 (Pal 14). Pal 14 is unusual in that its mean density is about 10 times smaller than that in the solar neighbourhood. Its large radius as well as its low-mass make it possible to simulate Pal 14 on a star-by-star basis. By varying the initial conditions, we aim at finding an initial N-body model which reproduces the observational data best in terms of its basic parameters, i.e. half-light radius, mass and velocity dispersion. We furthermore focus on reproducing the stellar mass function slope of Pal 14 which was found to be significantly shallower than in most globular clusters. While some of our models can reproduce Pal 14's basic parameters reasonably well, we find that dynamical mass segregation alone cannot explain the mass function slope of Pal 14 when starting from the canonical Kroupa initial mass function (IMF). In order to seek an explanation for this discrepancy, we compute additional initial models with varying degrees of primordial mass segregation as well as with a flattened IMF. The necessary degree of primordial mass segregation turns out to be very high, though, such that we prefer the latter hypothesis which we discuss in detail. This modelling has shown that the initial conditions of Pal 14 after gas expulsion must have been a half-mass radius of about 20 pc, a mass of about 50 000 M⊙, and possibly some mass segregation or an already established non-canonical IMF depleted in low-mass stars. Such conditions might be obtained by a violent early gas-expulsion phase from an embedded cluster born with mass segregation. Only at large Galactocentric radii are clusters likely to survive as bound entities the destructive gas-expulsion process we seem to have uncovered for Pal 14. In addition, we compute a model with a 5 per cent primordial binary fraction to test if such a population has an effect on the cluster's evolution. We see no significant effect, though, and moreover find that the binary fraction of Pal 14 stays almost the same and gives the final fraction over its entire lifetime due to the cluster's extremely low density. Low-density, halo globular clusters might therefore be good targets to test primordial binary fractions of globular clusters.},

The average metallicity is [Fe/H] = -0.5, in accordance with other determinations of the SMC's metallicity. The AGB stars show signs of envelope burning, being Li rich, C poor, and with a low 12C/13C ratio. The s-process elements (Rb, Zr, Nd) abundance pattern is different from that in the solar system, and is characteristic of a high exposure at low neutron density. This is not peculiar to the SMC, however, but seems to be an effect of metallicity: Galactic Ba, CH, and S-type stars at the same metallicity display similar s-process element abundance patterns. Apparently, the 13C neutron source is operating in these intermediate-mass thermally pulsing AGB stars.},

abstract = {There is increasing evidence for the presence of multiple red giant branches (RGBs) in the color-magnitude diagrams of massive globular clusters (GCs). In order to investigate the origin of this split on the RGB, we have performed new narrow-band Ca photometry and low-resolution spectroscopy for M22, NGC 1851, and NGC 288. We find significant differences (more than 4$\sigma$) in calcium abundance from the spectroscopic HK' index for M22 and NGC 1851. We also find more than 8$\sigma$ differences in CN-band strength between the Ca-strong and Ca-weak subpopulations for these GCs. For NGC 288, however, a large difference is detected only in the CN strength. The calcium abundances of RGB stars in this GC are identical to within the errors. This is consistent with the conclusion from our new Ca photometry where the RGB splits are confirmed in M22 and NGC 1851, but not in NGC 288. We also find interesting differences in the CN-CH correlations among these GCs. While CN and CH are anti-correlated in NGC 288, they show a positive correlation in M22. NGC 1851, however, shows no difference in CH between the two groups of stars with different CN strengths. We suggest that all of these systematic differences would be best explained by how strongly Type II supernovae enrichment has contributed to the chemical evolution of these GCs.},

abstract = {The development of the field of study of neutron capture processes in astrophysics is reviewed as a gradual evolution of improving microscopic input nuclear physics coupled with more sophisticated stellar models and computational technology. Particular emphasis is placed on discussion of contemporary scenarios for the stellar environments responsible for the nucleosynthesis of heavy nuclei. The division into slow (s-process) and rapid (r-process) nucleosynthesis regimes is described and the evolution toward scenarios which involve neutron fluxes intermediate between these two extremes is discussed. Uncertainties in the theories and input physics are highlighted.},

abstract = {We describe the design and construction of the ESO UV-visual echelle spectrograph and the performance that was measured during its commissioning 1999. UVES is a dual-beam, grating crossdispersed echelle spectrograph. The resolution for a 1 arcsecond slit is 40,000. With narrower slits, resolutions of up to 80,000 and 115,000 are achieved with adequate sampling. UVES provides order separations of minimum 10 arcseconds at any wavelength between 320 and 1050 nm. The wavelength coverage is 100 nm in the blue arm and 200 or 400 nm in the red arm, with possibility to use a dichroic. Some concepts pioneered in UVES are now increasingly being used in other echelle spectrograph for large telescopes: a white pupil design, very steep replicated mosaic echelles, and large refractive cameras with external focus. Regular observations are starting in April 2000 at the Nasmyth focus of Kueyen, Unit Telescope 2 of the VLT array.},

abstract = {Context. Clear power excess in a frequency range typical for solar-type oscillations in red giants has been detected in more than 1000 stars, which have been observed during the first 138 days of the science operation of the NASA Kepler satellite. This sample includes stars in a wide mass and radius range with spectral types G and K, extending in luminosity from the bottom of the giant branch up to high-luminous red giants, including the red bump and clump. The high-precision asteroseismic observations with Kepler provide a perfect source for testing stellar structure and evolutionary models, as well as investigating the stellar population in our Galaxy. Aims: We aim to extract accurate seismic parameters from the Kepler time series and use them to infer asteroseismic fundamental parameters from scaling relations and a comparison with red-giant models. Methods: We fit a global model to the observed power density spectra, which allows us to accurately estimate the granulation background signal and the global oscillation parameters, such as the frequency of maximum oscillation power. We find regular patterns of radial and non-radial oscillation modes and use a new technique to automatically identify the mode degree and the characteristic frequency separations between consecutive modes of the same spherical degree. In most cases, we can also measure the small separation between l = 0, 1, and 2 modes. Subsequently, the seismic parameters are used to estimate stellar masses and radii and to place the stars in an H-R diagram by using an extensive grid of stellar models that covers a wide parameter range. Using Bayesian techniques throughout our entire analysis allows us to determine reliable uncertainties for all parameters. Results: We provide accurate seismic parameters and their uncertainties for a large sample of red giants and determine their asteroseismic fundamental parameters. We investigate the influence of the stars' metallicities on their positions in the H-R diagram. Finally, we study the red-giant populations in the red clump and bump and compare them to a synthetic population. We find a mass and metallicity gradient in the red clump and clear evidence of a secondary-clump population.},

abstract = {High-precision HST photometry has revealed that the globular cluster (GC) NGC 2808 hosts a triple main sequence (MS) corresponding to three stellar populations with different helium abundances. We carried out photometry on ACS/WFC HST images of NGC 2808 with the main purpose of measuring the luminosity function (LF) of stars in the three different MSs, and the binary fraction in the cluster. We used isochrones to transform the observed LFs into mass functions (MFs). We estimate that the fraction of binary systems in NGC 2808 is fbin ≃ 0.05, and find that the three MSs have very similar LFs. The slopes of the corresponding MFs are $\alpha$ = -1.2 {\textpm} 0.3 for the red MS, $\alpha$ = -0.9 {\textpm} 0.3 for the middle MS, and $\alpha$ = -0.9 {\textpm} 0.4 for the blue one, the same, to within the errors. There is marginal evidence of a MF flattening for masses M $\le$ 0.6M⊙ for the the reddest (primordial) MS. These results represent the first direct measurement of the present-day MF and LF in distinct stellar populations of a GC, and provide constraints on models of the formation and evolution of multiple generations of stars in these objects. Based on observations with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by AURA, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555, under the programs GO-9899 and GO-10922.Appendices are available in electronic form at http://www.aanda.org},

However, observationally there is a fairly tight correlation between the O and Ne abundances as measured in planetary nebulae in various populations. In this paper we use recent detailed stellar evolutionary calculations for compositions appropriate to the Galaxy and the Large Magellanic Cloud, in an attempt to determine if the models are consistent with the observed abundances. We show that there is only a narrow range in stellar mass, about 2 to 4 Msolar (lower for lower [Fe/H]) where 22Ne is produced in sufficient quantities to affect the total observed elemental neon abundance, which is mostly 20Ne. The models appear to be consistent with the observations, but a more thorough analysis is required.},

abstract = {The authors present a simplified model of helium synthesis in the early universe. The purpose of the model is to explain clearly the physical ideas relevant to the cosmological helium synthesis in a manner that does not overlay these ideas with complex computer calculations. The model closely follows the standard calculation, except that it neglects the small effect of Fermi-Dirac statistics for the leptons. The temperature difference between photons and neutrinos during the period in which neutrons and protons interconvert is also neglected. These approximations permit the expression of neutron-proton conversion rates in a closed form, which agrees to 10% accuracy or better with the exact rates. Using these analytic expressions for the rates, the authors reduce the calculation of the neutron-proton ratio as a function of temperature to a simple numerical integral. They also estimate the effect of neutron decay on the helium abundance. Their result for this quantity agrees well with precise computer calculations. Their semianalytic formulas are used to determine how the predicted helium abundance varies with such parameters as the neutron lifetime, the baryon-to-photon ratio, the number of neutrino species, and a possible electron-neutrino chemical potential.},

abstract = {The envelope of thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch (TP-AGB) stars undergoing periodic third dredge-up (TDU) episodes is enriched in both light and heavy elements, the ashes of a complex internal nucleosynthesis involving p, $\alpha$, and n captures over hundreds of stable and unstable isotopes. In this paper, new models of low-mass AGB stars (2 M sun), with metallicity ranging between Z = 0.0138 (the solar one) and Z = 0.0001, are presented. Main features are (1) a full nuclear network (from H to Bi) coupled to the stellar evolution code, (2) a mass loss-period-luminosity relation, based on available data for long-period variables, and (3) molecular and atomic opacities for C- and/or N-enhanced mixtures, appropriate for the chemical modifications of the envelope caused by the TDU. For each model, a detailed description of the physical and chemical evolutions is presented; moreover, we present a uniform set of yields, comprehensive of all chemical species (from hydrogen to bismuth). The main nucleosynthesis site is the thin 13C pocket, which forms in the core-envelope transition region after each TDU episode. The formation of this 13C pocket is the principal by-product of the introduction of a new algorithm, which shapes the velocity profile of convective elements at the inner border of the convective envelope: both the physical grounds and the calibration of the algorithm are discussed in detail. We find that the pockets shrink (in mass) as the star climbs the AGB, so that the first pockets, the largest ones, leave the major imprint on the overall nucleosynthesis. Neutrons are released by the 13C($\alpha$, n)16O reaction during the interpulse phase in radiative conditions, when temperatures within the pockets attain T {\textasciitilde} 1.0 {\texttimes} 108 K, with typical densities of (106-107) neutrons cm-3. Exceptions are found, as in the case of the first pocket of the metal-rich models (Z = 0.0138, Z = 0.006 and Z = 0.003), where the 13C is only partially burned during the interpulse: the surviving part is ingested in the convective zone generated by the subsequent thermal pulse (TP) and then burned at T {\textasciitilde} 1.5 {\texttimes} 108 K, thus producing larger neutron densities (up to 1011 neutrons cm-3). An additional neutron exposure, caused by the 22Ne($\alpha$, n)25Mg during the TPs, is marginally activated at large Z, but becomes an important nucleosynthesis source at low Z, when most of the 22Ne is primary. The final surface compositions of the various models reflect the differences in the initial iron-seed content and in the physical structure of AGB stars belonging to different stellar populations. Thus, at large metallicities the nucleosynthesis of light s-elements (Sr, Y, Zr) is favored, whilst, decreasing the iron content, the overproduction of heavy s-elements (Ba, La, Ce, Nd, Sm) and lead becomes progressively more important. At low metallicities (Z = 0.0001) the main product is lead. The agreement with the observed [hs/ls] index observed in intrinsic C stars at different [Fe/H] is generally good. For the solar metallicity model, we found an interesting overproduction of some radioactive isotopes, like 60Fe, as a consequence of the anomalous first 13C pocket. Finally, light elements (C, F, Ne, and Na) are enhanced at any metallicity.},

abstract = {We present a chemical composition analysis of 36 giants in the nearby mildly metal-poor (<[Fe/H]>=-1.18) ``CN-bimodal'' globular cluster M4. The stars were observed at the Lick and McDonald Observatories using high-resolution {\'e}chelle spectrographs and at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory using the multiobject spectrometer. Confronted with a cluster having interstellar extinction that is large and variable across the cluster face, we combined traditional spectroscopic abundance methods with modifications to the line depth ratio technique pioneered by Gray to determine the atmospheric parameters of our stars. We derive a total-to-selective extinction ratio of 3.4+/-0.4 and an average <E(B-V)> reddening of 0.33+/-0.01, which is significantly lower than that estimated by using the dust maps made by Schlegel and coworkers. We determine abundance ratios typical of halo field and cluster stars for scandium, titanium, vanadium, nickel, and europium with star-to-star variations in these elements of less than +/-0.1. Silicon, aluminum, barium, and lanthanum are overabundant with respect to what is seen in other globular clusters of similar metallicity. These overabundances confirm the results of an earlier study by Brown {\&} Wallerstein based on a much smaller sample of M4 giants. Superposed on the primordial abundance distribution is evidence for the existence of proton capture synthesis of carbon, oxygen, neon, and magnesium. We recover some of the C, N, O, Na, Mg, and Al abundance swings and correlations found in other more metal-poor globular clusters, but the range of variation is muted. In the case of Mg and Al, this is compatible with the idea that the Al enhancements are derived from the destruction of ^25,26Mg, not ^24Mg. We determine that the C+N+O abundance sum is constant to within the observational errors and agrees with the C+N+O total that might be expected for M4 stars at birth. The asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars in M4 have C, N, and O abundances that show less evidence for proton capture nucleosynthesis than is found in the less evolved stars of the red giant branch (RGB). Deeply mixed stars of the RGB, subsequent to the helium core flash, might take up residence on the blue end of the horizontal branch and thus fail to evolve back to the AGB, but reasons for skepticism concerning this scenario are noted.},

abstract = {Helium-shell flashes have been studied in stars with a total mass Msun of 0.8, 1.0,2.0, and 3.0 Msun and hydrogen-depleted core masses Mc in the range 0.53-0.9 Msun. Particular attention was focused on the variation in surface luminosity resulting from the flash, since the peak surface luminosity during the flash cycle plays an important role in determining the termination point of asymptotic giant branch evolution. It was found that both the peak in surface luminosity at the flash (LP) and the quiescent luminosity maximum (LQ) occurring between each shell flash increase linearly with core mass. However, LP and LQ are shown to be independent of total stellar mass in the range of masses studied because envelope convection does not penetrate far enough into the star. Formulae are given for the dependence on MC of LP, LQ, the interpulse period, and the length of the interval during which the surface luminosity at the flash exceeds the quiescent maximum. Approximate formulae for the time dependence of the surface luminosity are also given. Rates of period change in the Mira variables R Hya, R Aql, and W Dra are compared with rates of change predicted by theoretical flash calculations and, as a result, constraints on the luminosity of these stars are derived via the theoretical relation between luminosity and rate of change of luminosity. The luminosities thus derived for R Hya and R Aql are compared with luminosities derived from pulsation theory.},

An attempt is made to disentangle the dependence of MLR on the three variables: Teff, L, and v(rot)sin(i) by empirically determining the relation over the HR diagram. It then appears that, for each point in the HR diagram, MLR depends only weakly on v(rot)sin(i), in agreement with theoretical predictions. For Be and shell stars the MLR for their high-latitude parts follows approximately the same rule as the one valid for non-Be stars, while the MLR from their equatorial areas is larger by a factor 100, in rough agreement with a theoretical prediction.},

abstract = {All models for the formation of multiple populations in globular clusters (GCs) imply an initial mass of the systems several times greater than the present mass. A recent study of the dwarf spheroidal galaxy Fornax, where the low-metallicity ([Fe/H] ≲ -2) stars contained in GCs appear to account for {\~{ }}20 per cent of the total number, seems to constrain the initial mass of the four low-metallicity GCs in Fornax to be at most a factor of 5-6 greater than their present mass. We examine the photometric data for Fornax clusters, focusing our attention on their horizontal branch (HB) colour distribution and, when available, on the fraction and period distribution of RR Lyrae variables. Based on our understanding of the HB morphology in terms of varying helium content (and red giant mass-loss rate) in the context of multiple stellar generations, we show that the clusters F2, F3 and F5 must contain substantial fractions of second-generation stars ({\~{ }}54-65 per cent). On the basis of a simple chemical evolution model we show that the helium distribution in these clusters can be reproduced by models with cluster initial masses ranging from values equal to {\~{ }}4 to {\~{ }}10 times greater than the current masses. Models with a very short second-generation star formation episode can also reproduce the observed helium distribution but require greater initial masses up to about 20 times the current mass. While the lower limit of this range of possible initial GC masses is consistent with those suggested by observations of the low-metallicity field stars, we also discuss the possibility that the metallicity scale of field stars (based on Ca II triplet spectroscopy) and the metallicities derived for the clusters in Fornax may not be consistent with each other. In this case, observational constraints would allow greater initial cluster masses. Two interesting hypotheses are needed in order to reproduce the HB morphology of the clusters F2, F3 and F5. (i) The first-generation HB stars all lie at `red' colours; that is, they populate only the RR Lyraes and the red HB region. According to this interpretation, the low-metallicity stars in the field of Fornax, populating the HB at colours bluer than the blue side [(V - I)0 ≲ 0.3 or (B - V)0 ≲ 0.2] of the RR Lyraes, should be second-generation stars born in the clusters. A preliminary analysis of available colour surveys of Fornax field provides a fraction {\~{ }}20 per cent of blue HB stars, in the low-metallicity range. (ii) The mass loss from individual second-generation red giants is a few per cent of a solar mass larger than the mass loss from first-generation stars.},

abstract = {Context. Recent investigations revealed very peculiar properties of blue horizontal branch (HB) stars in $\omega$ Centauri, which show anomalously low surface gravity and mass compared to other clusters and to theoretical models. $\omega$ Centauri, however, is a very unusual object, hosting a complex mix of multiple stellar populations with different metallicity and chemical abundances. Aims: We measured the fundamental parameters (temperature, gravity, and surface helium abundance) of a sample of 71 blue HB stars in M 22, with the aim of clarifying if the peculiar results found in $\omega$ Cen are unique to this cluster. M 22 also hosts multiple sub-populations of stars with a spread in metallicity, analogous to $\omega$ Cen. Methods: The stellar parameters were measured on low-resolution spectra fitting the Balmer and helium lines with a grid of synthetic spectra. From these parameters, the mass and reddening were estimated. Results: Our results on the gravities and masses agree well with theoretical expectations, matching the previous measurements in three "normal" clusters. The anomalies found in $\omega$ Cen are not observed among our stars. A mild mass underestimate is found for stars hotter than 14 000 K, but an exact analogy with $\omega$ Cen cannot be drawn. We measured the reddening in the direction of M 22 with two independent methods, finding E(B - V) = 0.35 {\textpm} 0.02 mag, with semi-amplitude of the maximum variation $\Delta$(E(B - V)) = 0.06 mag, and an rms intrinsic dispersion of $\sigma$(E(B - V)) = 0.03 mag.

abstract = {We use standard general relativity to illustrate and clarify several common misconceptions about the expansion of the universe. To show the abundance of these misconceptions we cite numerous misleading, or easily misinterpreted, statements in the literature. In the context of the new standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology we point out confusions regarding the particle horizon, the event horizon, the `observable universe' and the Hubble sphere (distance at which recession velocity=c). We show that we can observe galaxies that have, and always have had, recession velocities greater than the speed of light. We explain why this does not violate special relativity and we link these concepts to observational tests. Attempts to restrict recession velocities to less than the speed of light require a special relativistic interpretation of cosmological redshifts. We analyze apparent magnitudes of supernovae and observationally rule out the special relativistic Doppler interpretation of cosmological redshifts at a confidence level of 23 $\sigma$.},

As a result, the 13C efficiency needed for fitting most stars in the galactic disk is constrained to 1≲ 13C_eff≲ 2. In the same fashion we also study the [Pb/Ce] ratios of lead stars and find out that for low metallicities 13C_eff{\~{ }} 0.5.},

abstract = {We present an analysis of the response of a radiative region to waves generated by a convective region of the star; this wave treatment of the classical problem of ``overshooting'' gives extra mixing relative to the treatment traditionally used in stellar evolutionary codes. The interface between convectively stable and unstable regions is dynamic and nonspherical, so that the nonturbulent material is driven into motion, even in the absence of ``penetrative overshoot.'' These motions may be described by the theory of nonspherical stellar pulsations and are related to motion measured by helioseismology. Multidimensional numerical simulations of convective flow show puzzling features, which we explain by this simplified physical model. Gravity waves generated at the interface are dissipated, resulting in slow circulation and mixing seen outside the formal convection zone. The approach may be extended to deal with rotation and composition gradients (``semiconvection''). Tests of this description in the stellar evolution code TYCHO produce carbon stars on the asymptotic giant branch (AGB), an isochrone age for the Hyades and three young clusters with lithium depletion ages from brown dwarfs, and lithium and beryllium depletion consistent with observations of the Hyades and Pleiades, all without tuning parameters. The potential insight into the different contributions of rotational and hydrodynamic mixing processes could have important implications for realistic simulation of supernovae and other questions in stellar evolution.},

abstract = {Aluminum is the heaviest light element displaying large star-to-star variations in Galactic globular clusters (GCs). This element may provide additional insight into the origin of the multiple populations, now known to be common place in GCs, and also the nature of the first-generation stars responsible for a cluster's chemical inhomogeneities. In a previous analysis, we found that unlike more metal-poor GCs, 47 Tuc did not exhibit a strong Na-Al correlation, which motivates a careful study of the similar metallicity but less massive GC M71. We present chemical abundances of O, Na, Al, and Fe for 33 giants in M71 using spectra obtained with the WIYN-Hydra spectrograph. Our spectroscopic analysis finds that similar to 47 Tuc and in contrast with more metal-poor GCs, M71 stars do not exhibit a strong Na-Al correlation and span a relatively narrow range in [Al/Fe], which are characteristics that GC formation models must reproduce.

EMBLA utilizes SkyMapper photometry to pre-select metal-poor candidates, which are subsequently confirmed using AAOmega spectroscopy. We describe the discovery and analysis of four bulge giants with -2.72 $\le$ [Fe/H] $\le$ -2.48, the lowest metallicity bulge stars studied with high-resolution spectroscopy to date. Using FLAMES/UVES spectra through the Gaia-ESO Survey we have derived abundances of twelve elements. Given the uncertainties, we find a chemical similarity between these bulge stars and halo stars of the same metallicity, although the abundance scatter may be larger, with some of the stars showing unusual [$\alpha$/Fe] ratios.},

abstract = {Abundances of C, N, and O are determined in four bright red giants that span the known abundance range for light (Na and Al) and s-process (Zr and La) elements in the globular cluster NGC 1851. The abundance sum C+N+O exhibits a range of 0.6 dex, a factor of 4, in contrast to other clusters in which no significant C+N+O spread is found. Such an abundance range offers support for the Cassisi et al. scenario in which the double subgiant branch populations are coeval but with different mixtures of C+N+O abundances. Further, the Na, Al, Zr, and La abundances are correlated with C+N+O, and therefore NGC 1851 is the first cluster to provide strong support for the scenario in which asymptotic giant branch stars are responsible for the globular cluster light element abundance variations. This paper includes data gathered with the 6.5 meter Magellan Telescopes located at Las Campanas Observatory, Chile.},

abstract = {We present an extensive literature compilation of age, metallicity, and chemical abundance pattern information for the 41 Galactic globular clusters (GGCs) studied by Schiavon et al. Our compilation constitutes a notable improvement over previous similar work, particularly in terms of chemical abundances. Its primary purpose is to enable detailed evaluations of and refinements to stellar population synthesis models designed to recover the above information for unresolved stellar systems based on their integrated spectra. However, since the Schiavon sample spans a wide range of the known GGC parameter space, our compilation may also benefit investigations related to a variety of astrophysical endeavors, such as the early formation of the Milky Way, the chemical evolution of GGCs, and stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis. For instance, we confirm with our compiled data that the GGC system has a bimodal metallicity distribution and is uniformly enhanced in the $\alpha$ elements. When paired with the ages of our clusters, we find evidence that supports a scenario whereby the Milky Way obtained its globular clusters through two channels: in situ formation and accretion of satellite galaxies. The distributions of C, N, O, and Na abundances and the dispersions thereof per cluster corroborate the known fact that all GGCs studied so far with respect to multiple stellar populations have been found to harbor them. Finally, using data on individual stars, we verify that stellar atmospheres become progressively polluted by CN(O)-processed material after they leave the main sequence. We also uncover evidence which suggests that the $\alpha$ elements Mg and Ca may originate from more than one nucleosynthetic production site. We estimate that our compilation incorporates all relevant analyses from the literature up to mid-2012. As an aid to investigators in the fields named above, we provide detailed electronic tables of the data upon which our work is based at http://www.astro.queensu.ca/people/Stephane_Courteau/roediger2013/index.html.},

abstract = {Grids of models for rotating stars are constructed in the range of 9 to 120 Msun at solar metallicity. The following effects of rotation are included: shellular rotation, new structure equations for non-conservative case, surface distortions, increase of mass loss with rotation, meridional circulation and interaction with horizontal turbulence, shear instability and coupling with thermal effects, advection and diffusion of angular momentum treated in the non-stationary regime, transport and diffusion of the chemical elements. Globally we find that for massive stars the effects of rotation have an importance comparable to those of mass loss. Due to meridional circulation the internal rotation law Omega (r) rapidly converges, in 1-2% of the MS lifetime, towards a near equilibrium profile which then slowly evolves during the MS phase. The circulation shows two main cells. In the deep interior, circulation rises along the polar axis and goes down at the equator, while due to the Gratton-{\"O}pik term it is the inverse in outer layers. This external inverse circulation grows in depth as evolution proceeds. We emphasize that a stationary approximation and a diffusive treatment of meridional circulation would be inappropriate. After the MS phase, the effects of core contraction and envelope expansion dominate the evolution of the angular momentum. The surface velocities decrease very much during the MS evolution of the most massive stars, due to their high mass loss, which also removes a lot of angular momentum. This produces some convergence of the velocities, but not necessarily towards the break-up velocities. However, stars with masses below {\textasciitilde} 12 Msun with initially high rotation may easily reach the break-up velocities near the end of the MS phase, which may explain the occurrence of Be-stars. Some other interesting properties of the rotational velocities are pointed out. For an average rotation, the tracks in the HR diagram are modified like a moderate overshoot would do. In general, an average rotation may increase the MS lifetime up to about 30%; for the helium-burning phase the effects are smaller and amount to at most 10%. From plots of the isochrones, we find that rotation may increase the age estimate by about 25% in general. However, for stars with M >{\textasciitilde} 40 Msun and fast rotation, a bluewards ``homogeneous-like'' track, with important He- and N-enrichments, may occur drastically affecting the age estimates for the youngest clusters. Rotation also introduces a large scatter in the mass-luminosity relation: at the same log g_eff and log T_eff, differences of masses by 30% may easily occur, thus explaining what still remains of the alleged mass discrepancy. Rotation also brings significant surface He- and N-enhancements, they are higher for higher masses and rotation. While it is not difficult to explain very fast rotators with He- and N-excesses, the present models also well account for the many OB stars exhibiting surface enrichments and moderate or low rotation, (cf. Herrero et al. \cite{He92}, \cite{He20}). These stars likely result from initially fast rotators, which experienced mixing and lost a lot of angular momentum due to enhanced mass loss. The comparison of the N-excesses for B- and A-type supergiants supports the conclusion by Venn (\cite{ve95a}, \cite{Ve99}), that these enrichments mostly result from mixing during the MS phase, which is also in agreement with the results of Lyubimkov (\cite{Lyu96}).},

For massive stars, we discuss the ramifications of the fact that the time scale for mass loss (via stellar winds) during main sequence and red supergiant evolution can be comparable to the nuclear burning timescale, noting in particular the unusual distribution of stars in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, and the probability that significant mass loss is responsible for the chemically highly evolved spectra of Wolf-Rayet stars. finally, we sketch (1) recent progresses in following the evolution of massive stars to the presupernova stage, which is described by a configuration consisting of a core of near-Chandrasekhar mass made up of iron peak elements and a series of ``onion''-skin layers of less highly thermonuclearly processed matter and (2) recent progress in understanding the nature of the type II supernova phenomenon. For low and intermediate mass stars, we discuss postulated ``extramixing'' (beyond convective) processes, which may occur on the main sequence and on the first red giant branch, and continue on to a discussion of asymptotic giant branch evolution, placing considerable emphasis on the character of the thermal pulses that occur in such stars and, in particular, on the nucleosynthesis that occurs in the helium burning convective shells during these pulses and on the dredge-up phenomenon that brings fresh carbon and neutron-rich isotopes to the surface following pulse peak.},

We treat consistently the carbon-enhancement of the stellar envelopes by using opacity tables with varying C/O-ratio and by employing theoretical mass loss rates for carbon stars. The low temperature opacities have been calculated specifically for this project. For oxygen stars we use an empirical mass loss formalism. The third dredge-up is naturally obtained by including convective overshooting. Our models reach effective temperatures in agreement with earlier synthetic models, which included approximative carbon-enriched molecular opacities and show good agreement with empirically determined carbon-star lifetimes. A fraction of the models could be followed into the post-AGB phase, for which we provide models in a mass range supplementing previous post-AGB calculations. Our grid constitutes the most extensive set of AGB-models, calculated with the latest physical input data and treating carbon-enhancement due to the third dredge-up most consistently.

Many scenarios have been proposed to explain this peculiar chemical composition and most of them involve a binary companion producing the s-process elements during its Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) phase. The problem is that none of the proposed explanations appears to be able to account for all observational constraints, hence, alternatives are needed to be put forward and investigated. In this spirit, we propose a new scenario for the formation of CEMPs+r stars based on S. W. Campbell's finding that during the `dual core flash' in low-mass stars of extremely low metallicity, when protons are ingested in the He-flash convective zone, a `neutron superburst' is produced. Further calculations are needed to verify if this neutron superburst could make the r-process component observed in CEMPs+r, as well as their Fe abundances. The s-process component would then be produced during the following AGB phase.},

abstract = {This paper presents the first cosmological results based on Planck measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature and lensing-potential power spectra. We find that the Planck spectra at high multipoles ($\ell$ ≳ 40) are extremely well described by the standard spatially-flat six-parameter $\Lambda$CDM cosmology with a power-law spectrum of adiabatic scalar perturbations. Within the context of this cosmology, the Planck data determine the cosmological parameters to high precision: the angular size of the sound horizon at recombination, the physical densities of baryons and cold dark matter, and the scalar spectral index are estimated to be $\theta${\textasteriskcentered} = (1.04147 {\textpm} 0.00062) {\texttimes} 10-2, $\Omega$bh2 = 0.02205 {\textpm} 0.00028, $\Omega$ch2 = 0.1199 {\textpm} 0.0027, and ns = 0.9603 {\textpm} 0.0073, respectively(note that in this abstract we quote 68% errors on measured parameters and 95% upper limits on other parameters). For this cosmology, we find a low value of the Hubble constant, H0 = (67.3 {\textpm} 1.2) km s-1 Mpc-1, and a high value of the matter density parameter, $\Omega$m = 0.315 {\textpm} 0.017. These values are in tension with recent direct measurements of H0 and the magnitude-redshift relation for Type Ia supernovae, but are in excellent agreement with geometrical constraints from baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) surveys. Including curvature, we find that the Universe is consistent with spatial flatness to percent level precision using Planck CMB data alone. We use high-resolution CMB data together with Planck to provide greater control on extragalactic foreground components in an investigation of extensions to the six-parameter $\Lambda$CDM model. We present selected results from a large grid of cosmological models, using a range of additional astrophysical data sets in addition to Planck and high-resolution CMB data. None of these models are favoured over the standard six-parameter $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. The deviation of the scalar spectral index from unity isinsensitive to the addition of tensor modes and to changes in the matter content of the Universe. We find an upper limit of r0.002< 0.11 on the tensor-to-scalar ratio. There is no evidence for additional neutrino-like relativistic particles beyond the three families of neutrinos in the standard model. Using BAO and CMB data, we find Neff = 3.30 {\textpm} 0.27 for the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, and an upper limit of 0.23 eV for the sum of neutrino masses. Our results are in excellent agreement with big bang nucleosynthesis and the standard value of Neff = 3.046. We find no evidence for dynamical dark energy; using BAO and CMB data, the dark energy equation of state parameter is constrained to be w = -1.13-0.10+0.13. We also use the Planck data to set limits on a possible variation of the fine-structure constant, dark matter annihilation and primordial magnetic fields. Despite the success of the six-parameter $\Lambda$CDM model in describing the Planck data at high multipoles, we note that this cosmology does not provide a good fit to the temperature power spectrum at low multipoles. The unusual shape of the spectrum in the multipole range 20 ≲ $\ell$ ≲ 40 was seen previously in the WMAP data and is a real feature of the primordial CMB anisotropies. The poor fit to the spectrum at low multipoles is not of decisive significance, but is an "anomaly" in an otherwise self-consistent analysis of the Planck temperature data.},

abstract = {We present copper abundances for 14 red giant stars in the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy (Sgr dSph), showing that [Cu/Fe] is deficient by {\textasciitilde}0.5 dex, relative to the Galactic trend. This is most easily understood as due to an enhanced contribution of iron peak nucleosynthesis products from Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). The deficient [Cu/Fe] ratios might also be the result of a metallicity-dependent yield from SNe Ia, similar to previous conclusions for Mn, although SN Ia nucleosynthesis predictions suggest a negligible Cu yield. The enhanced SN Ia products, suggested by our low [Cu/Fe] ratios, fit a leaky box chemical evolution scenario for the Sgr dSph, where ejecta from the old, metal-poor, population overwhelmed nucleosynthesis products from younger generations, resulting in young stars with uncharacteristic compositions. The only other system known to have unusually low [Cu/Fe] is the Galactic globular cluster $\omega$ Cen, which, like the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy, has strong enhancements of s-process elements. Thus, our copper abundances lend support to the idea that $\omega$ Cen is the remaining nucleus of an accreted dwarf galaxy.},

abstract = {We present stellar evolutionary sequences for asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars in the Magellanic Cloud clusters NGC 1978, NGC 1846, and NGC 419. The new stellar models for the three clusters match the observed effective temperatures on the giant branches, the oxygen-rich to carbon-rich transition luminosities, and the AGB-tip luminosities. A major finding is that a large amount of convective overshoot (up to 3 pressure scale heights) is required at the base of the convective envelope during third dredge-up in order to get the correct oxygen-rich to carbon-rich transition luminosity. The stellar evolution sequences are used as input for detailed nucleosynthesis calculations. For NGC 1978 and NGC 1846 we compare our model results to the observationally derived abundances of carbon and oxygen. We find that additional mixing processes (extra mixing) are required to explain the observed abundance patterns. For NGC 1846 we conclude that non-convective extra mixing processes are required on both the red giant branch and the AGB, in agreement with previous studies. For NGC 1978 it is possible to explain the C/O and 12C/13C abundances of both the O-rich and the C-rich AGB stars by assuming that the material in the intershell region contains high abundances of both C and O. This may occur during a thermal pulse when convective overshoot at the inner edge of the flash-driven convective pocket dredges C and O from the core to the intershell. For NGC 419 we provide our predicted model abundance values although there are currently no published observed abundance studies for the AGB stars in this cluster.},

abstract = {Near the ends of their lives, low- and intermediate-mass stars go through a phase of evolution known as the asymptotic giant branch1,2. This luminous red-giant phase is thought to be terminated by a period of intense mass loss in the form of a superwind3, which leads to the formation of a planetary nebula. Although the effects of mass loss have been studied extensively in many stars, the duration of this phase is not well constrained, because of uncertainties in the distances, masses, ages, and absolute luminosities of the observed stars. On the other hand, the properties of stars in the globular clusters associated with the Magellanic Clouds are not subject to these uncertainties, and so provide an excellent opportunity for studying mass-loss phenomena in a quantitative way. Here we report the discovery of two infrared stars in Magellanic Cloud globular clusters that are undergoing a period of intense mass loss. Those observations, together with those of a previously discovered infrared star, confirm that asymptotic giant branch stars go through a superwind phase, and constrain the duration of this phase to be about 100,000 years.},

abstract = {Aims: We investigate the relation between 1D atmosphere models that rely on the mixing length theory and models based on full 3D radiative hydrodynamic (RHD) calculations to describe convection in the envelopes of late-type stars. Methods: The adiabatic entropy value of the deep convection zone, sbot, and the entropy jump, $\Delta$s, determined from the 3D RHD models, were matched with the mixing length parameter, $\alpha$MLT, from 1D hydrostatic atmosphere models with identical microphysics (opacities and equation-of-state). We also derived the mass mixing length parameter, $\alpha$m, and the vertical correlation length of the vertical velocity, C[vz,vz], directly from the 3D hydrodynamical simulations of stellar subsurface convection. Results: The calibrated mixing length parameter for the Sun is $\alpha${\&}{\#}3663;MLT (Sbot) = 1.98. . For different stellar parameters, $\alpha$MLT varies systematically in the range of 1.7 - 2.4. In particular, $\alpha$MLT decreases towards higher effective temperature, lower surface gravity and higher metallicity. We find equivalent results for $\alpha${\&}{\#}3663;MLT ($\Delta$S). In addition, we find a tight correlation between the mixing length parameter and the inverse entropy jump. We derive an analytical expression from the hydrodynamic mean-field equations that motivates the relation to the mass mixing length parameter, $\alpha$m, and find that it qualitatively shows a similar variation with stellar parameter (between 1.6 and 2.4) with the solar value of $\alpha${\&}{\#}3663;m = 1.83.. The vertical correlation length scaled with the pressure scale height yields 1.71 for the Sun, but only displays a small systematic variation with stellar parameters, the correlation length slightly increases with Teff. Conclusions: We derive mixing length parameters for various stellar parameters that can be used to replace a constant value. Within any convective envelope, $\alpha$m and related quantities vary strongly. Our results will help to replace a constant $\alpha$MLT.

abstract = {By using high-resolution spectra acquired with FLAMES-GIRAFFE at the ESO/VLT, we measured the radial and rotational velocities for 110 blue straggler stars (BSSs) in $\omega$ Centauri, the globular cluster-like stellar system harboring the largest known BSS population. According to their radial velocities, 109 BSSs are members of the system. The rotational velocity distribution is very broad, with the bulk of BSSs spinning at less than {\textasciitilde}40 km s-1 (in agreement with the majority of such stars observed in other globular clusters) and a long tail reaching {\textasciitilde}200 km s-1. About 40% of the sample has ve sin i > 40 km s-1 and about 20% has ve sin i > 70 km s-1. Such a large fraction is very similar to the percentage of fast rotating BSSs observed in M4. Thus, $\omega$ Centauri is the second stellar cluster, beyond M4, with a surprisingly high population of fast spinning BSSs. We found a hint of radial behavior for a fraction of fast rotating BSSs, with a mild peak within one core radius, and a possible rise in the external regions (beyond four core radii). This may suggest that recent formation episodes of mass transfer BSSs occurred preferentially in the outskirts of $\omega$ Centauri, or that braking mechanisms able to slow down these stars are least efficient in the lowest density environments. Based on observations collected at the ESO-VLT under the programs 077.D-0696(A), 081.D-0356(A), and 089.D-0298(A).},

abstract = {We present theoretical evolutionary sequences of intermediate-mass stars (M = 3 - 6.5Msolar) with metallicity Z = 0.004. Our goal is to test whether the self-enrichment scenario by massive asymptotic giant branch stars may work for the high-metallicity globular clusters, after previous works by the same group showed that the theoretical yields by this class of objects can reproduce the observed trends among the abundances of some elements, namely the O-Al and O-Na anticorrelations, at intermediate metallicities, i.e. [Fe/H] = -1.3. We find that the increase in the metallicity favours only a modest decrease of the luminosity and the temperature at the bottom of the envelope for the same core mass, and also the efficiency of the third dredge-up is scarcely altered. On the contrary, differences are found in the yields, due to the different impact that processes with the same efficiency have on the overall abundance of envelopes with different metallicities. We expect the same qualitative patterns as in the intermediate-metallicity case, but the slopes of some of the relationships among the abundances of some elements are different. We compare the sodium-oxygen anticorrelation for clusters of intermediate metallicity (Z {\textasciitilde} 10-3) and clusters of metallicity large as in these new models. Although the observational data are still too scarce, the models are consistent with the observed trends, provided that only stars of M >{\textasciitilde} 5Msolar contribute to self-enrichment.},

We combine the analysis of the photometric data obtained from the Hubble Space Telescope UV Legacy Survey of Galactic GCs GO-13297, with chemical abundances by Yong et al., and compare the photometry with models in order to analyse the multiple stellar sequences we identified in the colour-magnitude diagram. We find three main stellar components, composed of metal-poor, metal-intermediate, and metal-rich stars (hereafter referred to as population A, B, and C, respectively). The components A and B include stars with different s-process element abundances. They host six sub-populations with different light-element abundances, and exhibit an internal variation in helium up to $\Delta$Y {\~{ }} 0.07 dex. In contrast with M22, another cluster characterized by the presence of populations with different metallicities, M2 contains a third stellar component, C, which shows neither evidence for sub-populations nor an internal spread in light-elements. Population C does not exhibit the typical photometric signatures that are associated with abundance variations of light elements produced by hydrogen burning at hot temperatures. We compare M2 with other GCs with intrinsic heavy-element variations and conclude that M2 resembles M22, but it includes an additional stellar component that makes it more similar to the central region of the Sagittarius galaxy, which hosts a GC (M54) and the nucleus of the Sagittarius galaxy itself.},

abstract = {We numerically investigate abundance properties of the Galactic globular clusters (GCs) by adopting a new `external pollution' scenario. In this framework, GCs are assumed to originate in forming low-mass dwarfs embedded in dark matter subhaloes at very high redshifts (z) and thus be chemically influenced by field asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars of the dwarfs during early GC formation processes. GCs within a dwarf galaxy therefore can be formed from the mixture of (i) gas ejected from the field AGB stars formed earlier in the dwarf and (ii) the interstellar gas infalling to the central region of the dwarf. In this external pollution scenario, the ratio of the total mass of infalling gas to that of AGB ejecta during GC formation in a dwarf (s) and the time-scale of gas infall ($\sigma$I) are the most important key parameters that can determine abundance properties of GCs. We mainly investigate the abundance inhomogeneity among light elements (e.g. C, N, O, Na and Al) of stars in GCs by using the latest stellar yield models of metal-poor AGB stars with and without third dredge-up. Our principal results for the models with no third dredge-up, which are more consistent with observations, are as follows. (i) Both [N/Fe] and [C/Fe] can be diverse among stars within a GC owing to chemical pollution from field AGB stars. [N/Fe] distributions in some GCs can clearly show bimodality, whereas [C/Fe] is monomodal in most models. [N/Fe] distributions depend on s such that models with smaller s (i.e. larger mass fraction of AGB ejecta used for GC formation) show the [N/Fe] bimodality more clearly. (ii) N-rich, C-poor stars in GCs also have higher He abundances owing to pollution from massive AGB stars with He-rich ejecta. The number fraction of He-rich stars (Y > 0.30) is higher for the models with smaller s and shorter $\sigma$I for 3 <= s <= 24 and 105 <= $\sigma$I <= 107 yr. He abundances of stars correlate with [N/Fe] and [Al/Fe] and anticorrelate with [C/Fe], [O/Fe] and [Na/Fe] within GCs in our models. (iii) Although our model can much better explain the observed C-N and Mg-Al anticorrelations than previous theoretical models, it is in strong disagreement with the observed O-Na anticorrelation. (iv) This model naturally provides an explanation for the large fraction of CN-strong stars without recourse to an implausible initial mass function. Based on these results for the above external pollution scenario, we discuss the long-standing problem of the CN-bimodality prevalent in the Galactic GCs, the possible helium abundance inhomogeneity in these systems and their horizontal branch morphologies.},

abstract = {We present new theoretical stellar evolutionary models of metal-rich asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. Stellar models are evolved with initial masses between 1 and 7 M⊙ at Z = 0.007, and 1 and 8 M⊙ at Z = 0.014 (solar) and at Z = 0.03. We evolve models with a canonical helium abundance and with helium-enriched compositions (Y = 0.30, 0.35, and 0.40) at Z = 0.014 and 0.03. The efficiency of third dredge-up and the mass range of carbon stars decreases with an increase in metallicity. We predict carbon stars form from initial masses between 1.75 and 7 M⊙ at Z = 0.007 and between 2 and 4.5 M⊙ at solar metallicity. At Z = 0.03, the mass range for C-star production is narrowed to 3.25-4 M⊙. The third dredge-up is reduced when the helium content of the model increases owing to the reduced number of thermal pulses on the AGB. A small increase of $\Delta$Y = 0.05 is enough to prevent the formation of C stars at Z = 0.03, depending on the mass-loss rate, whereas at Z = 0.014, an increase of $\Delta$Y ≳ 0.1 is required to prevent the formation of C stars. We speculate that the probability of finding C stars in a stellar population depends as much on the helium abundance as on the metallicity. To explain the paucity of C stars in the inner region of M31, we conclude that the observed stars have Y ≳ 0.35 or that the stellar metallicity is higher than [Fe/H] $\approx$ 0.1.},

abstract = {We present the COLIBRI code for computing the evolution of stars along the thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch (TP-AGB) phase. Compared to purely synthetic TP-AGB codes, COLIBRI relaxes a significant part of their analytic formalism in favour of a detailed physics applied to a complete envelope model, in which the stellar structure equations are integrated from the atmosphere down to the bottom of the hydrogen-burning shell. This allows us to predict self-consistently: (i) the effective temperature, and more generally the convective envelope and atmosphere structures, correctly coupled to the changes in the surface chemical abundances and gas opacities; (ii) the conditions under which sphericity effects may significantly affect the atmospheres of giant stars; (iii) the core mass-luminosity relation and its possible break-down due to the occurrence of hot-bottom burning (HBB) in the most massive AGB stars, by taking properly into account the nuclear energy generation in the H-burning shell and in the deepest layers of the convective envelope; (iv) the HBB nucleosynthesis via the solution of a complete nuclear network (including the pp chains, and the CNO, NeNa and MgAl cycles) coupled to a diffusive description of mixing, suitable to follow also the synthesis of 7Li via the Cameron-Fowler beryllium transport mechanism; (v) the intershell abundances left by each thermal pulse via the solution of a complete nuclear network applied to a simple model of the pulse-driven convective zone (PDCZ); (vi) the onset and quenching of the third dredge-up, with a temperature criterion that is applied, at each thermal pulse, to the result of envelope integrations at the stage of the post-flash luminosity peak. At the same time, COLIBRI pioneers new techniques in the treatment of the physics of stellar interiors, not yet adopted in full TP-AGB models. It is the first evolutionary code ever to use accurate on-the-fly computation of the equation of state (EoS) for roughly 800 atoms, ions, molecules and of the Rosseland mean opacities throughout the atmosphere and the deep envelope. This ensures a complete consistency, step by step, of both EoS and opacity with the evolution of the chemical abundances caused by the third dredge-up and HBB. Another distinguishing aspect of COLIBRI is its high computational speed, which allows to generate complete grids of TP-AGB models in just a few hours. This feature is absolutely necessary for calibrating the many uncertain parameters and processes that characterize the TP-AGB phase. We illustrate the many unique features of COLIBRI by means of detailed evolutionary tracks computed for several choices of model parameters, including initial star masses, chemical abundances, nuclear reaction rates, efficiency of the third dredge-up, overshooting at the base of the PDCZ, etc. Future papers in this series will deal with the calibration of all these and other parameters using observational data of AGB stars in the Galaxy and in nearby systems, a step that is of paramount importance for producing reliable stellar population synthesis models of galaxies up to high redshift.},

abstract = {A new generation of low-frequency radio telescopes is seeking to observe the redshifted 21 cm signal from the epoch of reionization (EoR), requiring innovative methods of calibration and imaging to overcome the difficulties of wide-field low-frequency radio interferometry. Precise calibration will be required to separate the expected small EoR signal from the strong foreground emission at the frequencies of interest between 80 and 300 MHz. The Moon may be useful as a calibration source for detection of the EoR signature, as it should have a smooth and predictable thermal spectrum across the frequency band of interest. Initial observations of the Moon with the Murchison Widefield Array 32 tile prototype show that the Moon does exhibit a similar trend to that expected for a cool thermally emitting body in the observed frequency range, but that the spectrum is corrupted by reflected radio emission from Earth. In particular, there is an abrupt increase in the observed flux density of the Moon within the internationally recognized frequency modulated (FM) radio band. The observations have implications for future low-frequency surveys and EoR detection experiments that will need to take this reflected emission from the Moon into account. The results also allow us to estimate the equivalent isotropic power emitted by the Earth in the FM band and to determine how bright the Earth might appear at meter wavelengths to an observer beyond our own solar system.},

abstract = {AGB stars are responsible for producing a variety of elements, including carbon, nitrogen, and the heavy elements produced in the slow neutron-capture process (s-elements). There are many uncertainties involved in modelling the evolution and nucleosynthesis of AGB stars, and this is especially the case at low metallicity, where most of the stars with high enough masses to enter the AGB have evolved to become white dwarfs and can no longer be observed. The stellar population in the Galactic halo is of low mass (≲0.85 M⊙) and only a few observed stars have evolved beyond the first giant branch. However, we have evidence that low-metallicity AGB stars in binary systems have interacted with their low-mass secondary companions in the past. The aim of this work is to investigate AGB nucleosynthesis at low metallicity by studying the surface abundances of chemically peculiar very metal-poor stars of the halo observed in binary systems. To this end we select a sample of 15 carbon- and s-element-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP-s) halo stars that are found in binary systems with measured orbital periods. With our model of binary evolution and AGB nucleosynthesis, we determine the binary configuration that best reproduces, at the same time, the observed orbital period and surface abundances of each star of the sample. The observed periods provide tight constraints on our model of wind mass transfer in binary stars, while the comparison with the observed abundances tests our model of AGB nucleosynthesis. For most of the stars in our sample, we find that an episode of efficient wind mass transfer, combined with strong angular momentum loss, has occurred in the past. In some cases we find discrepancies between the observed and modelled abundances even if we adopt a fine-tuned set of parameters in our binary evolution model. These discrepancies are probably caused by missing physical ingredients in our models of AGB nucleosynthesis and they provide indications of how to improve our knowledge of the process of nucleosynthesis in AGB stars.

abstract = {Aims: Precise abundance ratios are determined for 94 dwarf stars with Teff K, -1.6 < [Fe/H] < -0.4, and distances D ⪉ 335 pc. Most of them have halo kinematics, but 16 thick-disk stars are included. Methods: Equivalent widths of atomic lines are measured from VLT/UVES and NOT/FIES spectra with resolutions R≃ 55 000 and R ≃ 40 000, respectively. An LTE abundance analysis based on MARCS models is applied to derive precise differential abundance ratios of Na, Mg, Si, Ca, Ti, Cr, and Ni with respect to Fe. Results: The halo stars fall into two populations, clearly separated in [$\alpha$/Fe], where $\alpha$ refers to the average abundance of Mg, Si, Ca, and Ti. Differences in [Na/Fe] and [Ni/Fe] are also present with a remarkably clear correlation between these two abundance ratios. Conclusions: The {\textquotedblleft}high-$\alpha${\textquotedblright} stars may be ancient disk or bulge stars {\textquotedblleft}heated{\textquotedblright} to halo kinematics by merging satellite galaxies or they could have formed as the first stars during the collapse of a proto-Galactic gas cloud. The kinematics of the {\textquotedblleft}low-$\alpha${\textquotedblright} stars suggest that they have been accreted from dwarf galaxies, and that some of them may originate from the $\omega$ Cen progenitor galaxy.

abstract = {Nearly all globular clusters (GCs) studied to date show evidence for multiple stellar populations, in stark contrast to the conventional view that GCs are a mono-metallic, coeval population of stars. This generic feature must therefore emerge naturally within massive star cluster formation. Building on earlier work, we propose a simple physical model for the early evolution (several 108 yr) of GCs. We consider the effects of stellar mass loss, Type II supernovae (SNe II) and prompt Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), ram pressure, and accretion from the ambient interstellar medium (ISM) on the development of a young GC's own gas reservoir. In our model, SNe II from a first generation of star formation clears the GC of its initial gas reservoir. Over the next several 108 yr, mass lost from asymptotic giant branch stars and matter accreted from the ambient ISM collect at the center of the GC. This material must remain quite cool (T {\textasciitilde} 102 K), but does not catastrophically cool on a crossing time because of the high Lyman-Werner flux density in young GCs. The collection of gas within the GC must compete with ram pressure from the ambient ISM. After several 108 yr, the Lyman-Werner photon flux density drops by more than three orders of magnitude, allowing molecular hydrogen and then stars to form. After this second generation of star formation, SNe II from the second generation and then prompt SNe Ia associated with the first generation maintain a gas-free GC, thereby ending the cycle of star formation events. Our model makes clear predictions for the presence or absence of multiple stellar populations within GCs as a function of GC mass and formation environment. While providing a natural explanation for the approximately equal number of first- and second-generation stars in GCs, substantial accretion from the ambient ISM may produce fewer chemically peculiar second-generation stars than are observed. Analyzing intermediate-age LMC clusters, we find for the first time evidence for a mass threshold of {\textasciitilde}104 M sun below which LMC clusters appear to be truly coeval. This threshold mass is consistent with our predictions for the mass at which ram pressure is capable of clearing gas from clusters in the LMC at the present epoch. Recently, claims have been made that multiple populations within GCs require that GCs form at the center of their own dark matter halos. We argue that such a scenario is implausible. Observations of the young and intermediate-age clusters in the LMC and M31 will provide strong constraints on our proposed scenario.},

abstract = {Context: The low-metallicity RV Tauri star MACHO 47.2496.8, recently discovered in the Large Magellanic Cloud, is highly enriched in carbon and heavy elements produced by the slow neutron capture process (s-process), and is most probably a genuine post-C(N-type) asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star. The intrinsic interpretation of the enrichement is further strengthened by detection of a significant infrared excess. The circumstellar dust is the relic of a recent episode of heavy mass loss. We use the analysis of the abundances of MACHO 47.2496.8 to constrain free parameters in AGB models. Aims: We test which values of the free parameters describing uncertain physical mechanisms in AGB stars, namely the third dredge-up and the features of the 13C neutron source, produce models that better match the abundances observed in MACHO 47.2496.8. Methods: We carry out stellar population synthesis coupled with s-process nucleosynthesis using a synthetic stellar evolution code. Results: The s-process ratios observed in MACHO 47.2496.8 can be matched by the same models that explain the s-process ratios of Galactic AGB and post-AGB stars of metallicity >Z⊙/10, except for the choice of the effectiveness of 13C as a neutron source, which has to be lower by roughly a factor of 3 to 6. The less effective neutron source for lower metallicities is also required when comparing population synthesis results to observations of Galactic halo s-enhanced stars, such as Pb stars. The 12C/13C ratio in MACHO 47.2496.8 cannot be matched simultaneously and requires the occurrence of extra-mixing processes. Conclusions: The confirmed trend of the decreased efficiency of the 13C neutron source with metallicity requires an explanation from AGB s-process models. The present work is to date the first comparison between theoretical models and the detailed abundances of an extragalactic post-AGB star.},

abstract = {New spectroscopic observations show that the double-degenerate system NLTT 16249 is in a close orbit (a = 5.6 {\textpm} 0.3 R ⊙) with a period of 1.17 days. The total mass of the system is estimated between 1.47 and 2.04 M ⊙ but it is not expected to merge within a Hubble timescale (t merge $\approx$ 1011 yr). Vennes {\&} Kawka originally identified the system because of the peculiar composite hydrogen (DA class) and molecular (C2-DQ class and CN) spectra and the new observations establish this system as the first DA plus DQ close double degenerate. Also, the DQ component was the first of its class to show nitrogen dredged up from the core in its atmosphere. The star may be viewed as the first known DQ descendant of the born-again PG1159 stars. Alternatively, the presence of nitrogen may be the result of past interactions and truncated evolution in a close binary system.

Helium enhancement relative to standard isochrones is confirmed at the 2.3$\sigma$ level. We obtain an upper bound on the helium enrichment for the metal-rich ([Fe/H] $\approx$+0.30) stars of $\Delta$Y $\approx$ +0.11 relative to canonical expectations, given the requirement that the spectroscopic and photometric ages be consistent and the limiting condition of instantaneous star formation. We discuss phenomenological evidence that the bulge may have had a chemical evolution that is distinct from the solar neighborhood in this manner, and we make several testable predictions. Should this emerging picture of the bulge as helium-enhanced hold, it will require the development of new isochrones, new model atmospheres, and modified analysis and cosmological interpretation of the integrated light of other bulges and elliptical galaxies.},

L1615/L1616 is a cometary cloud in which the star formation was triggered by the impact of massive stars in the Orion OB association. From the measurements of the lithium abundance and radial velocity, we confirm the membership of our sample to the cloud. We use the equivalent widths of the H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, and the He i $\lambda$5876, $\lambda$6678, $\lambda$7065 {\AA} emission lines to calculate the accretion luminosities, Lacc, and the mass accretion rates, {\.{M}}acc. We find in L1615/L1616 a fraction of accreting objects ({\textasciitilde}30%), which is consistent with the typical fraction of accretors in T associations of similar age ({\textasciitilde}3 Myr). The mass accretion rate for these stars shows a trend with the mass of the central object similar to that found for other star-forming regions, with a spread at a given mass that depends on the evolutionary model used to derive the stellar mass. Moreover, the behavior of the 2MASS/WISE colors with {\.{M}}acc indicates that strong accretors with log {\.{M}}acc ≳ -8.5 dex show large excesses in the JHKs bands, as in previous studies. We also conclude that the accretion properties of the L1615/L1616 members are similar to those of young stellar objects in T associations, like Lupus.

abstract = {We compare model predictions to observations of star counts in the red giant branch bump (RGBB) relative to the number density of first-ascent red giant branch at the magnitude of the RGBB, EWRGBB. The predictions are shown to exceed the data by (5.2 {\textpm} 4.3) per cent for the BaSTI models and by (17.1 {\textpm} 4.3) per cent for the Dartmouth models, where the listed errors are purely statistical. These two offsets are brought to zero if the Galactic globular cluster metallicity scale is assumed to be overestimated by a linear shift of {\~{ }}0.11 and {\~{ }}0.36 dex, respectively. This inference based on RGBB star counts goes in the opposite direction to the increase in metallicities of $\Delta$[M/H] $\approx$ 0.20 dex that would be required to fix the offset between predicted and observed RGBB luminosities. This comparison is a constraint on `deep-mixing' models of stellar interiors, which predict decreased RGBB star counts. We tabulate the predictions for RGBB star counts as a function of [Fe/H], [$\alpha$/Fe], CNONa, initial helium abundance, and age. Though our study suggests a small zero-point calibration issue, RGBB star counts should nonetheless be an actionable parameter with which to constrain stellar populations in the differential sense. The most significant outliers are towards the clusters NGC 5024 (M53), NGC 6723, and NGC 7089 (M2), each of which shows a {\~{ }}2$\sigma$ deficit in their RGBB star counts.},

abstract = {A large number of spectroscopic studies have provided evidence of the presence of multiple populations in globular clusters by revealing patterns in the stellar chemical abundances. This paper is aimed at studying the origin of these abundance patterns. We explore a model in which second generation (SG) stars form out of a mix of pristine gas and ejecta of the first generation of asymptotic giant branch stars. We first study the constraints imposed by the spectroscopic data of SG stars in globular clusters on the chemical properties of the asymptotic and super asymptotic giant branch ejecta. With a simple one-zone chemical model, we then explore the formation of the SG population abundance patterns focusing our attention on the Na-O, Al-Mg anticorrelations and on the helium distribution function (HDF). We carry out a survey of models and explore the dependence of the final SG chemical properties on the key parameters affecting the gas dynamics and the SG formation process. Finally, we use our chemical evolution framework to build specific models for NGC 2808 and M4, two Galactic globular clusters which show different patterns in the Na-O and Mg-Al anticorrelation and have different helium distributions. We find that the amount of pristine gas involved in the formation of SG stars is a key parameter to fit the observed O-Na and Mg-Al patterns. The HDF for these models is in general good agreement with the observed one. Our models, by shedding light on the role of different parameters and their interplay in determining the final SG chemical properties, illustrate the basic ingredients, constraints and problems encountered in this self-enrichment scenario which must be addressed by more sophisticated chemical and hydrodynamic simulations.},

abstract = {A new mechanism for enhancing the helium abundance in the blue main sequence stars of $\omega$ Centauri and NGC 2808 is investigated. We suggest that helium enhancement was caused by the inhomogeneous big bang nucleosynthesis. Regions with extremely high baryon-to-photon ratios are assumed to be caused by the baryogenesis. Its mass scale is also assumed to be 106M⊙. An example of the mechanisms to realize these two things was already proposed as the Affleck-Dine baryogenesis. As the baryon-to-photon ratio becomes larger, the primordial helium abundance is enhanced. We calculated the big bang nucleosynthesis and found that there exists a parameter region yielding enough helium to account for the split of the main sequence in the aforementioned globular clusters while keeping the abundance of other elements compatible with observations. Our mechanism predicts that heavy elements with the mass number of around 100 is enhanced in the blue main sequence stars. We estimate the time scales of diffusion of the enhanced helium and mass accretion in several stages after the nucleosynthesis to investigate whether these processes diminish the enhancement of helium. We found that the diffusion does not influence the helium content. A cloud with a sufficiently large baryon-to-photon ratio to account for the multiple main sequence collapsed immediately after the recombination. Subsequently, the cloud accreted the ambient matter with the normal helium content. If the star formation occurred both in the collapsed core and the accreted envelope, then the resultant star cluster has a double main sequence.},

abstract = {Aims: We investigate the long-term dynamical evolution of two distinct stellar populations of low-mass stars in globular clusters in order to study whether the energy equipartition process can explain the high number of stars harbouring abundance anomalies seen in globular clusters. Methods: We analyse N-body models by artificially dividing the low-mass stars (m$\le$0.9 M_⊙) into two populations: a small number of stars (second generation) consistent with an invariant IMF and with low specific energies initially concentrated towards the cluster-centre mimic stars with abundance anomalies. These stars form from the slow winds of fast-rotating massive stars. The main part of low-mass (first generation) stars has the pristine composition of the cluster. We study in detail how the two populations evolve under the influence of two-body relaxation and the tidal forces due to the host galaxy. Results: Stars with low specific energy initially concentrated toward the cluster centre need about two relaxation times to achieve a complete homogenisation throughout the cluster. For realistic globular clusters, the number ratio between the two populations increases only by a factor 2.5 due to the preferential evaporation of the population of outlying first generation stars. We also find that the loss of information on the stellar orbital angular momentum occurs on the same timescale as spatial homogenisation. Conclusions: To reproduce the high number of chemically anomalous stars in globular clusters by preserving an invariant IMF, more efficient mechanisms such as primordial gas expulsion are needed to expel the stars in the outer cluster parts on a short timescale.},

abstract = {Aims:We investigate variability and we model the pulsational behaviour of AGB variables in the intermediate-age LMC cluster NGC 1846. Methods: Our own photometric monitoring has been combined with data from the MACHO archive to detect 22 variables among the cluster's AGB stars and to derive pulsation periods. According to the global parameters of the cluster we construct pulsation models taking into account the effect of the C/O ratio on the atmospheric structure. In particular, we have used opacities appropriate for both O-rich stars and carbon stars in the pulsation calculations. Results: The observed P-L-diagram of NGC 1846 can be fitted using a mass of the AGB stars of about 1.8 M⊙. We show that the period of pulsation is increased when an AGB star turns into a carbon star. Using the mass on the AGB defined by the pulsational behaviour of our sample we derive a cluster age of 1.4{\texttimes}109 years. This is the first time the age of a cluster has been derived from the variability of its AGB stars. The carbon stars are shown to be a mixture of fundamental and first overtone radial pulsators.

This model, together with the theory of cosmic inflation, makes a clear prediction for the initial conditions for structure formation and predicts that structures grow hierarchically through gravitational instability. Testing this model requires that the precise measurements delivered by galaxy surveys can be compared to robust and equally precise theoretical calculations. Here we present a simulation of the growth of dark matter structure using 2,1603 particles, following them from redshift z = 127 to the present in a cube-shaped region 2.230 billion lightyears on a side. In postprocessing, we also follow the formation and evolution of the galaxies and quasars. We show that baryon-induced features in the initial conditions of the Universe are reflected in distorted form in the low-redshift galaxy distribution, an effect that can be used to constrain the nature of dark energy with future generations of observational surveys of galaxies.},

For each of the three indicators used, we conduct a thorough error analysis, and identify systematic errors in the computational procedures. For the population ratio RNHBNRGB, we find that there is no evidence of a trend with metallicity, although there appears to be real scatter in the values derived. Although this indicator is the one best able to provide useful absolute helium abundances, the mean value is Y{\textasciitilde}0.20, indicating the probable presence of additional systematic error. For the magnitude difference from the horizontal branch to the main sequence $\Delta$ and the RR Lyrae mass-luminosity exponent A, it is only possible to determine relative helium abundances reliably. This is due to continuing uncertainties in the absolute metallicity scale for $\Delta$, and uncertainty in the RR Lyrae temperature scale for A. Both indicators imply that the helium abundance is approximately constant as a function of [Fe/H]. According to the A indicator, both Oosterhoff I and II group clusters have constant values independent of [Fe/H] and horizontal branch type. In addition, the two groups have slopes dlog<Pab>/d[Fe/H] that are consistent with each other, but significantly smaller than the slope for the combined sample.},

abstract = {Color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) derived from Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Advanced Camera for Surveys F606W, F814W photometry of six globular clusters (GCs) are presented. The six GCs form two loose groupings in Galactocentric distance (R GC): IC 4499, NGC 6426, and Ruprecht 106 at {\textasciitilde}15-20 kpc and NGC 7006, Palomar 15, and Pyxis at {\textasciitilde}40 kpc. The CMDs allow the ages to be estimated from the main-sequence turnoff in every case. In addition, the age of Palomar 5 (R GC {\textasciitilde} 18 kpc) is estimated using archival HST Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 V, I photometry. The age analysis reveals the following: IC 4499, Ruprecht 106, and Pyxis are 1-2 Gyr younger than inner halo GCs with similar metallicities; NGC 7006 and Palomar 5 are marginally younger than their inner halo counterparts; NGC 6426 and Palomar 15, the two most metal-poor GCs in the sample, are coeval with all the other metal-poor GCs within the uncertainties. Combined with our previous efforts, the current sample provides strong evidence that the Galactic GC age-metallicity relation consists of two distinct branches. One suggests a rapid chemical enrichment in the inner Galaxy while the other suggests prolonged GC formation in the outer halo. The latter is consistent with the outer halo GCs forming in dwarf galaxies and later being accreted by the Milky Way.

abstract = {We present the abundance analysis of a sample of more than 120 red giants in the globular cluster (GC) NGC 1851, based on FLAMES spectra. We find a small but detectable metallicity spread. This spread is compatible with the presence of two different groups of stars with a metallicity difference of 0.06-0.08 dex, in agreement with earlier photometric studies. If stars are divided into these two groups according to their metallicity, both components show Na-O anticorrelation (signature of a genuine GC nature) of moderate extension. The metal-poor stars are more concentrated than the metal-rich ones. We tentatively propose the hypothesis that NGC 1851 formed from a merger of two individual GCs with a slightly different Fe and $\alpha$-element content and possibly an age difference up to 1 Gyr. This is also supported by number ratios of stars on the split subgiant and on the bimodal horizontal branches. The distribution of n-capture process elements in the two components also supports the idea that the enrichment must have occurred in each of the structures separately and not as a continuum of events in a single GC. The most probable explanation is that the proto-clusters formed into a (now dissolved) dwarf galaxy and later merged to produce the present GC.

abstract = {We show that the X-ray line flux of the Mn K$\alpha$ line at 5.9 keV from the decay of 55Fe is a promising diagnostic to distinguish between Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) explosion models. Using radiation transport calculations, we compute the line flux for two three-dimensional explosion models: a near-Chandrasekhar mass delayed detonation and a violent merger of two (1.1 and 0.9 M⊙) white dwarfs. Both models are based on solar metallicity zero-age main-sequence progenitors. Due to explosive nuclear burning at higher density, the delayed-detonation model synthesizes {\~{ }}3.5 times more radioactive 55Fe than the merger model. As a result, we find that the peak Mn K$\alpha$ line flux of the delayed-detonation model exceeds that of the merger model by a factor of {\~{ }}4.5. Since in both models the 5.9-keV X-ray flux peaks five to six years after the explosion, a single measurement of the X-ray line emission at this time can place a constraint on the explosion physics that is complementary to those derived from earlier phase optical spectra or light curves. We perform detector simulations of current and future X-ray telescopes to investigate the possibilities of detecting the X-ray line at 5.9 keV. Of the currently existing telescopes, XMM-Newton/pn is the best instrument for close (≲1-2 Mpc), non-background limited SNe Ia because of its large effective area. Due to its low instrumental background, Chandra/ACIS is currently the best choice for SNe Ia at distances above {\~{ }}2 Mpc. For the delayed-detonation scenario, a line detection is feasible with Chandra up to {\~{ }}3 Mpc for an exposure time of 106 s. We find that it should be possible with currently existing X-ray instruments (with exposure times ≲5 {\texttimes} 105 s) to detect both of our models at sufficiently high S/N to distinguish between them for hypothetical events within the Local Group. The prospects for detection will be better with future missions. For example, the proposed Athena/X-IFU instrument could detect our delayed-detonation model out to a distance of {\~{ }}5 Mpc. This would make it possible to study future events occurring during its operational life at distances comparable to those of the recent supernovae SN 2011fe ({\~{ }}6.4 Mpc) and SN 2014J ({\~{ }}3.5 Mpc).},

abstract = {We present a comprehensive multiwavelength photometric analysis of the innermost ({\~{ }}3 {\texttimes} 3 kpc2) 110 globular clusters (GCs) of M87. Their spectral energy distributions (SEDs) were built taking advantage of new ground-based high-resolution near-infrared imaging aided by adaptive optics at the Very Large Telescope combined with Hubble Space Telescope ultraviolet-optical archival data. These GC SEDs are among the best photometrically sampled extragalactic GC SEDs. To compare with our SEDs we constructed equally sampled SEDs of Milky Way GCs. Using both these Milky Way cluster templates and different stellar population models, ages of >10 Gyr and metallicities of [Fe/H] {\~{ }}-0.6 dex are consistently inferred for the inner GCs of M87. In addition, the metallicity of these GCs is low ($\Delta$[Fe/H] {\~{ }}0.8 dex) compared to that of their host galaxy. These results agree with the idea that the GC formation in M87 ceased earlier than that of the bulk of the stars of the central part of the galaxy. The ages of the inner GCs of M87 support the idea that these central parts of the galaxy formed first. Our data do not support evidence of recent wet merging.},

abstract = {Context. Star HE 1327-2326 is a unique object, with the lowest measured iron abundance ([Fe/H] {\textasciitilde} -6) and a peculiar chemical composition that includes large overabundances of C, N, and O with respect to iron. One important question is whether the chemical abundances in this star reflect the chemical composition of the gas cloud from which it was formed or if they have been severely affected by other processes, such as dust-gas winnowing. Aims: We measure or provide an upper limit to the abundance of the volatile element sulphur, which can help to discriminate between the two scenarios. Methods: We observed HE 1327-2326 with the high resolution infra-red spectrograph CRIRES at the VLT to observe the S i lines of Multiplet 3 at 1045 nm. Results: We do not detect the S i line. A 3$\sigma$ upper limit on the equivalent width (EW) of any line in our spectrum is EW < 0.66 pm. Using either one-dimensional static or three-dimensional hydrodynamical model-atmospheres, this translates into a robust upper limit of [S/H] < -2.6. Conclusions: This upper limit does not provide conclusive evidence for or against dust-gas winnowing, and the evidence coming from other elements (e.g., Na and Ti) is also inconclusive or contradictory. The formation of dust in the atmosphere versus an origin of the metals in a metal-poor supernova with extensive "fall-back" are not mutually exclusive. It is possible that dust formation distorts the peculiar abundance pattern created by a supernova with fall-back, thus the abundance ratios in HE 1327-2326 may be used to constrain the properties of the supernova(e) that produced its metals, but with some caution. Based on spectra obtained with CRIRES at the 8.2 m Antu ESO telescope, programme 386.D-0095.},

abstract = {Dust grains in neutral gas behave as aerodynamic particles, so they can develop large local density fluctuations entirely independent of gas density fluctuations. Specifically, gas turbulence can drive order-of-magnitude "resonant" fluctuations in the dust density on scales where the gas stopping/drag timescale is comparable to the turbulent eddy turnover time. Here we show that for large grains (size >{\textasciitilde} 0.1 $\mu$m, containing most grain mass) in sufficiently large molecular clouds (radii >{\textasciitilde} 1-10 pc, masses >{\textasciitilde} 104 M {\&}{\#}9737;), this scale becomes larger than the characteristic sizes of prestellar cores (the sonic length), so large fluctuations in the dust-to-gas ratio are imprinted on cores. As a result, star clusters and protostellar disks formed in large clouds should exhibit significant abundance spreads in the elements preferentially found in large grains (C, O). This naturally predicts populations of carbon-enhanced stars, certain highly unusual stellar populations observed in nearby open clusters, and may explain the "UV upturn" in early-type galaxies. It will also dramatically change planet formation in the resulting protostellar disks, by preferentially "seeding" disks with an enhancement in large carbonaceous or silicate grains. The relevant threshold for this behavior scales simply with cloud densities and temperatures, making straightforward predictions for clusters in starbursts and high-redshift galaxies. Because of the selective sorting by size, this process is not necessarily visible in extinction mapping. We also predict the shape of the abundance distribution{\textemdash}when these fluctuations occur, a small fraction of the cores may actually be seeded with abundances Z {\textasciitilde} 100 langZrang such that they are almost "totally metal" (Z {\textasciitilde} 1)! Assuming the cores collapse, these totally metal stars would be rare (1 in {\textasciitilde}104 in clusters where this occurs), but represent a fundamentally new stellar evolution channel.},

The evolution is fully computed, by assuming a mass loss rate consistent with the observations of the Magellanic Clouds lithium-rich stars, and modelling convection with the Full Spectrum of Turbulence model by Canuto and Mazzitelli. The results are discussed in the framework of their importance for the evolution of proto-Globular Clusters, whose spectra show that the stars are very probably formed from matter contaminated by the ejecta of these stars, or have accreted it after formation. The main results we find are the following: 1) for metallicities Z <= 10-3, masses above {\textasciitilde} 4 Msun suffer complete CNO cycling in HBB, so that they show at the surface the result of this process, and the oxygen abundance is reduced; 2) most models suffer the third dredge up. Although carbon is processed to nitrogen by HBB, the oxygen burning is so strong in the lowest metallicities (2 x 10-4) that carbon becomes more abundant than oxygen: in other words, low-metallicity intermediate mass stars may show up as carbon stars due to the drastic oxygen burning; 3) if Globular Cluster stars are contaminated by matter processed through these phases, we must expect a non negligible helium enhancement in their composition: from a Big Bang abundance Y=0.24, e.g., we might expect an abundance Y=0.28. This may have no practical consequences if pollution concerns only the external parts of the stars, but is very important if the stars formed as a whole from a helium rich environment. 4) The lithium yields, although not important for galactic chemical evolution, are very interestingly close to the initial Big Bang abundance: processing by HBB is the only way in which we can obtain substantial amounts of gas which have gone through full CNO burning, but preserve a reasonable abundance of lithium.},

We studied the abundances of Na, Mg, and Al in the atmospheres of 103 red giant branch stars located below (49 stars) and above (54 stars) the RGB bump in the GGC 47 Tuc. Our results show that the spread of [Na/Fe] abundance ratios is about three times larger than that of [Mg/Fe]. Our data also confirm the existence of weak Na-Al correlation, similar to the one observed in other GGCs. At the same time, we find no evidence for the existence of three populations of stars characterized with different abundances of aluminum, as reported recently by \citet{Ca13}.},

abstract = {The detailed nature of the general nonstatic homogeneous isotropic cosmological model as derived from general relativity is discussed for early epochs in the case of a medium consisting of elementary particles and radiation which can undergo interconversion. The question of the validity of the description afforded by this model for the very early super-hot state is discussed. The present model with matter-radiation interconversion exhibits behavior different from non-interconverting models, principally because of the successive freezing-in or annihilation of various constituent particles as the temperature in the expanding universe decreased with time. The numerical results are unique in that they involve no disposable parameters which would affect the time dependence of pressure, temperature, and density. The study of the elementary particle reactions leads to the time dependence of the proton-neutron concentration ratio, a quantity required in problems of nucleogenesis. This ratio is found to lie in the range {\textasciitilde}4.5:1-{\textasciitilde}6.0:1 at the onset of nucleogenesis. These results differ from those of Hayashi mainly as a consequence of the use of a cosmological model with matter-radiation interconversion and of relativistic quantum statistics, as well as a different value of the neutron half-life.},

abstract = {We study the existence, stability, and dynamics of multivortex discrete solitons in a centrally coupled ring of nonlinear waveguides. A detailed analysis of possible geometrical configurations of globally linked elementary vortices within a stationary state is presented, together with the studies of their linear stability and perturbed dynamics. We identify regimes with robust switching between different vortex configurations, induced via the coordinated flipping of all vortex charges in a cluster, adiabatic spiraling of vortex lines, or spontaneous decay of unstable vortex clusters into stable solitons. These three mechanisms allow for all-optical switching between six topologically distinct vortex configurations.},

abstract = {We present a chemical abundance analysis of 300S-1, the brightest likely member star of the 300 km s-1 stream near the faint satellite galaxy Segue 1. From a high-resolution Magellan/MIKE spectrum, we determine a metallicity of [Fe/H] = -1.46 {\textpm} 0.05 {\textpm} 0.23 (random and systematic uncertainties) for star 300S-1, and find an abundance pattern similar to typical halo stars at this metallicity. Comparing our stellar parameters to theoretical isochrones, we estimate a distance of 18 {\textpm} 7 kpc. Both the metallicity and distance estimates are in good agreement with what can be inferred from comparing the Sloan Digital Sky Survey photometric data of the stream stars to globular cluster sequences. While several other structures overlap with the stream in this part of the sky, the combination of kinematic, chemical, and distance information makes it unlikely that these stars are associated with either the Segue 1 galaxy, the Sagittarius Stream, or the Orphan Stream. Streams with halo-like abundance signatures, such as the 300 km s-1 stream, present another observational piece for understanding the accretion history of the Galactic halo. This paper includes data gathered with the 6.5 m Magellan Telescopes located at Las Campanas Observatory, Chile.},

abstract = {Type Ia Supernova (SN Ia) are a powerful, albeit not completely understood, tool for cosmology. Gaps in our understanding of their progenitors and detailed physics can lead to systematic errors in the cosmological distances they measure. We use UV data in two context to help further our understanding of SN Ia progenitors and physics. We analyze a set of nearly 700 light curves, and find no signature of the shock heating of a red giant companion, predicted by Kasen (Astrophys. J. 708:1025, 2010), casting doubt as to frequency of this SN Ia channel. We also use UV imaging of high redshift host galaxies of SN Ia to better understand the environments which SN Ia occur. We show that some high-z elliptical galaxies have current star formation, hindering efforts to use them as low-extinction environments. We show cosmological scatter of SN distances at large effective radii in their hosts is significantly reduced, and argue this is due to the smaller amounts of dust affecting the SN Ia. Finally, we find a two component dependence of SN distance measurements as a function of their host galaxy's FUV-V color. This indicates that both the age and metallicity/mass of the host galaxy maybe important ingredients in measuring SN Ia distances.},

abstract = {One of the strongest absorption lines observed in far-ultraviolet FUSE spectra of many PG 1159 stars remained unidentified up to now. We show that this line, located at 973.3 {\AA}, stems from Ne VII. We also present new optical high-resolution spectra of PG 1159 stars, obtained with the ESO VLT, which cover the Ne VII 3644 {\AA} line and a newly identified Ne VII multiplet in the 3850-3910 {\AA} region. We compare the observed neon lines with NLTE models and conclude a substantial neon overabundance in a number of objects. Although a detailed analysis is still to be performed in order to compare quantitatively the abundances with evolutionary theory predictions, this corroborates the idea that the PG 1159 stars and their immediate progenitors, the [WC]-type nuclei of planetary nebulae, display intershell matter of their precursor AGB stars. Possibly as the consequence of a late He-shell flash, H-deficient and (s-processed) Fe-depleted matter, that is strongly enriched by 3$\alpha$-processed elements (C, O, Ne), is dredged up to the surface. Hence, a detailed study of the element abundance patterns in these peculiar stars gives the unique possibility to probe mixing and nucleosynthesis processes in the precursor AGB stars.

abstract = {The enrichment of Pb in the Galaxy is followed in the framework of a detailed model of Galactic chemical evolution that already proved adequate to reproduce the chemical enrichment of O and of the elements from Ba to Eu. The stellar yields are computed through nucleosynthesis calculations in the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase of low- and intermediate-mass stars covering a wide range of metallicities. The physical parameters of the stellar structure were derived from full stellar evolutionary models computed previously. We show that low-mass AGB stars are the main producers of Pb in the Galaxy, with a complex dependence on metallicity and a maximum efficiency at [Fe/H]{\textasciitilde}-1. Our calculations succeed in reproducing the abundances of Pb isotopes in the solar system: the role attributed by the classical analysis of the s-process to the strong component, in order to explain more than 50% of solar 208Pb, is actually played by the high production of Pb in low-mass and low-metallicity AGB stars. We then follow the Galactic chemical evolution of Pb isotopes and give our expectations on the s-process contribution to each of them at the epoch of the solar system formation. Finally, we present new spectroscopic estimates of Pb abundance on a sample of field stars and compare them, together with a few other determinations available, with the predicted trend of [Pb/Fe] in the Galaxy.},

abstract = {Aims: We use the growing data sets of very-metal-poor stars to study the impact of stellar winds of fast rotating massive stars on the chemical enrichment of the early Galaxy. Methods: We use an inhomogeneous chemical evolution model for the Galactic halo to predict both the mean trend and scatter of C/O and N/O. In one set of models, we assume that massive stars enrich the interstellar medium during both the stellar wind and supernovae phases. In the second set, we consider that in the earliest phases (Z < 10-8), stars with masses above 40 {M}⊙ only enrich the interstellar medium via stellar winds, collapsing directly into black holes. Results: We predict a larger scatter in the C/O and N/O ratios at low metallicities when allowing the more massive fast-rotating stars to contribute to the chemical enrichment only via stellar winds. The latter assumption, combined with the stochasticity in the star formation process in the primordial Galactic halo can explain the wide spread observed in the N/O and C/O ratios in normal very-metal-poor stars. Conclusions: For chemical elements with stellar yields that depend strongly on initial mass (and rotation) such as C, N, and neutron capture elements, within the range of massive stars, a large scatter is expected once the stochastic enrichment of the early interstellar medium is taken into account. We also find that stellar winds of fast rotators mixed with interstellar medium gas are not enough to explain the large CNO enhancements found in most of the carbon-enhanced very-metal-poor stars. In particular, this is the case of the most metal-poor star known to date, HE 1327-2326, for which our models predict lower N enhancements than observed when assuming a mixture of stellar winds and interstellar medium. We suggest that these carbon-enhanced very metal-poor stars were formed from almost pure stellar wind material, without dilution with the pristine interstellar medium.},

Assuming that the progenitor of $\omega$ Cen is a dwarf elliptical galaxy, we model it with a King model with a core radius the same as that of $\omega$ Cen. A dark matter halo of the dwarf is not taken into account. We consider two different models of the Milky Way potential: a singular isothermal sphere and a three-component model. The progenitor dwarf is expressed as an N-body system, which orbits in the fixed Galactic potential. The dwarf lost more than 90% of its mass during the first few pericenter passages. Thereafter, the mass remains practically constant. The final surface density profile is in good agreement with the observational data on $\omega$ Cen, if the pericenter distance of the orbit of the progenitor dwarf is around 500 pc. This value is within the error bar of the current proper-motion data on $\omega$ Cen and Galactic parameters. Although our simulation is limited to a King-like progenitor dwarf without a dark matter halo, it strongly suggests that the current density profile of $\omega$ Cen is nicely reproduced by a tidal stripping scenario, in other words, that $\omega$ Cen can plausibly be identified with a stripped dwarf elliptical galaxy.},

abstract = {Young massive clusters (YMCs) are dense aggregates of young stars that form the fundamental building blocks of galaxies. Several examples exist in the Milky Way Galaxy and the Local Group, but they are particularly abundant in starburst and interacting galaxies. The few YMCs that are close enough to resolve are of prime interest for studying the stellar mass function and the ecological interplay between stellar evolution and stellar dynamics. The distant unresolved clusters may be effectively used to study the star-cluster mass function, and they provide excellent constraints on the formation mechanisms of young cluster populations. YMCs are expected to be the nurseries for many unusual objects, including a wide range of exotic stars and binaries. So far only a few such objects have been found in YMCs, although their older cousins, the globular clusters, are unusually rich in stellar exotica. In this review, we focus on star clusters younger than {\~{ }}100 Myr, more than a few current crossing times old, and more massive than {\~{ }}104M⊙; the size of the cluster and its environment are considered less relevant as distinguishing parameters. We describe the global properties of the currently known young massive star clusters in the Local Group and beyond, and discuss the state of the art in observations and dynamical modeling of these systems. In order to make this review readable by observers, theorists, and computational astrophysicists, we also review the cross-disciplinary terminology.},

The helium rich stars show higher effective temperatures, much higher luminosities and therefore shorter time scales.

abstract = {Aims: We investigate the early evolution of two distinct populations of low-mass stars in globular clusters under the influence of primordial gas expulsion driven by supernovae and study whether this process can increase the fraction of second generation stars at the level required by observations. Methods: We analyse N-body models that take the effect of primordial gas expulsion into account. We divide the stars into two populations that mimic the chemical and dynamical properties of stars in globular clusters so that second-generation stars start with a more centrally concentrated distribution. Results: The main effect of gas expulsion is to eject mostly first-generation stars while second-generation stars remain bound to the cluster. In the most favourable cases, second-generation stars can account for 60% of the bound stars we see today. We also find that, at the end of the gas expulsion phase, the radial distribution of the two populations is still different, so that long-term evolution will further increase the fraction of second generation stars. Conclusions: The large fraction of chemically anomalous stars is readily explainable as a second generation of stars formed out of the slow winds of rapidly rotating massive stars if globular clusters suffer explosive residual gas expulsion for a star formation efficiency of about 0.33.},

abstract = {The carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars constitute approximately one fifth of the metal-poor ([Fe/H] ⪉ -2) population but their origin is not well understood. The most widely accepted formation scenario, at least for the majority of CEMP stars which are also enriched in s-process elements, invokes mass-transfer of carbon-rich material from a thermally-pulsing asymptotic giant branch (TPAGB) primary star to a less massive main-sequence companion which is seen today. Recent studies explore the possibility that an initial mass function biased toward intermediate-mass stars is required to reproduce the observed CEMP fraction in stars with metallicity [Fe/H]<-2.5. These models also implicitly predict a large number of nitrogen-enhanced metal-poor (NEMP) stars which is not seen. In this paper we investigate whether the observed CEMP and NEMP to extremely metal-poor (EMP) ratios can be explained without invoking a change in the initial mass function. We construct binary-star populations in an attempt to reproduce the observed number and chemical abundance patterns of CEMP stars at a metallicity [Fe/H]{\~{ }}-2.3. Our binary-population models include synthetic nucleosynthesis in TPAGB stars and account for mass transfer and other forms of binary interaction. This approach allows us to explore uncertainties in the CEMP-star formation scenario by parameterization of uncertain input physics. In particular, we consider the uncertainty in the physics of third dredge up in the TPAGB primary, binary mass transfer and mixing in the secondary star. We confirm earlier findings that with current detailed TPAGB models, in which third dredge up is limited to stars more massive than about 1.25{\textasciitilde}M⊙, the large observed CEMP fraction cannot be accounted for. We find that efficient third dredge up in low-mass (less than 1.25{\textasciitilde}M⊙), low-metallicity stars may offer at least a partial explanation for the large observed CEMP fraction while remaining consistent with the small observed NEMP fraction.

It is argued in the literature that the flux of this supernova rises too fast to be explained by the explosion model due to the instability associated with the electron-positron pair production (pair-instability supernova, PISNe), but it is well described by the models with energy input by a magnetar. We show that the PTF12dam-type supernovae can be explained without a magnetar in a model with a radiative shock in a dense circumstellar envelope that does not require an excessively large explosion energy.},

abstract = {The evolution of intermediate-mass stars at very low metallicity during their final thermal pulse asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase is studied in detail. As representative examples, models with initial masses of 4 and 5Msolar and with a metallicity of Z=0.0001 ([Fe/H]{\textasciitilde}-2.3) are discussed. The one-dimensional stellar structure and evolution model includes time- and depth-dependent overshooting motivated by hydrodynamic simulations, as well as a full nuclear network and time-dependent mixing. Particular attention is given to high time and space resolution to avoid numerical artifacts related to third dredge-up and hot bottom burning predictions. The model calculations predict very efficient third dredge-up that mixes the envelope with the entire intershell layer or a large fraction thereof and in some cases penetrates into the C/O core below the He shell. In all cases primary oxygen is mixed into the envelope. The models predict efficient envelope burning during the interpulse phase. Depending on the envelope-burning temperature, oxygen is destroyed to varying degrees. The combined effect of dredge-up and envelope burning does not lead to any significant oxygen depletion in any of the cases considered in this study. The large dredge-up efficiency in our model is closely related to the particular properties of the H shell during the dredge-up phase in low-metallicity very metal-poor stars, which is followed here over many thermal pulses. During the dredge-up phase, the temperature just below the convective boundary is large enough for protons to burn vigorously when they are brought into the C-rich environment below the convection boundary by the time- and depth-dependent overshooting. H-burning luminosities of 105 to {\textasciitilde}2{\texttimes}106Lsolar are generated. C, and to lesser degree O, is transformed into N in this dredge-up overshooting layer and enters the envelope. The global effect on the CNO abundance is similar to that of hot bottom burning. If the overshoot efficiency is larger, then dredge-up H burning causes a further increase in the dredge-up efficiency. After some thermal pulses, the dredge-up proceeds through the He shell and into the CO core beneath. Then neutrons may not be released from 13C in radiative conditions during the interpulse phase because of the scarcity of $\alpha$-particles for the 13C($\alpha$,n)16O reactions. Conditions for the s-process are discussed qualitatively. The abundance evolution of H, He, C, N, O, and Na is described. Finally, the model predictions for sodium and oxygen are compared with observed abundances. The notion that massive AGB stars are the origin of the O-Na abundance anticorrelation in globular cluster giants is not consistent with the model predictions of this study. The abundance of the C-rich extremely metal-poor binaries LP 625-44, CS 29497-030, and HE 0024-2523 is discussed.},

abstract = {M 22 is an anomalous globular cluster that hosts two groups of stars with different metallicity and s-element abundance. The star-to-star light-element variations in both groups, with the presence of individual Na-O and C-N anticorrelations, demonstrates that this Milky Way satellite has experienced a complex star formation history. We have analyzed FLAMES/UVES spectra for seven stars covering a small color interval on the reddest horizontal branch (HB) portion of this cluster and investigated possible relations between the chemical composition of a star and its location along the HB. Our chemical abundance analysis takes into account effects introduced by deviations from the local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE effects), which are significant for the measured spectral lines in the atmospheric parameters range spanned by our stars. We find that all the analyzed stars are barium-poor and sodium-poor, thus supporting the idea that the position of a star along the HB is strictly related to the chemical composition, and that the HB morphology is influenced by the presence of different stellar populations.

We concentrate on the RR Lyrae variable stars in the cluster, and make a particular effort to accurately reidentify the previously discovered variables. We have also discovered two new probable RR Lyrae variables in the M4 field: one of them by its position on the sky and its photometric properties is a probable member of the cluster, and the second is a probable background (bulge?) object. We provide accurate equatorial coordinates for all 47 stars identified as RR Lyraes, new photometric measurements for 46 of them, and new period estimates for 45. We have also derived accurate positions and mean photometry for 34 more stars previously identified as variable stars of other types, and for an additional five non-RR Lyrae variable stars identified for the first time here. We present optical and near-infrared color-magnitude diagrams for the cluster and show the locations of the variable stars in them. We present the Bailey (period-amplitude) diagrams and the period-frequency histogram for the RR Lyrae stars in M4 and compare them to the corresponding diagrams for M5 (NGC 5904). We conclude that the RR Lyrae populations in the two clusters are quite similar in all the relevant properties that we have considered.

For clusters of total mass M500 ≃ 1014 M⊙, nice agreement is found between their iron content and what is expected from empirical supernova yields. For the same clusters, there also appears to be at least as much iron in the ICM as there is still locked into stars (i.e. the ICM/stars' metal share is about unity). However, for more massive clusters, the stellar mass fraction appears to drop substantially without being accompanied by a drop in the ICM metallicity, thus generating a major tension with the nucleosynthesis expectation and inflating the metal share to extremely high values (up to {\~{ }}6). Various possible solutions of this conundrum are discussed, but are all considered either astrophysically implausible, or lacking an independent observational support. For this reason, we still entertain the possibility that even some of the best cluster data may be faulty, though we are not able to identify any obvious bias. Finally, based on the stellar mass-metallicity relation for local galaxies, we estimate the contribution of galaxies to the ICM enrichment as a function of their mass, concluding that even the most massive galaxies must have lost a major fraction of the metals they have produced.},

abstract = {We present results from the JINA REACLIB project, an ongoing effort to maintain a current and accurate library of thermonuclear reaction rates for astrophysical applications. Ongoing updates are transparently documented and version tracked, and any set of rates is publicly available and can be downloaded via a Web interface at http://groups.nscl.msu.edu/jina/reaclib/db/. We discuss here our library V1.0, a snapshot of recommended rates for stable and explosive hydrogen and helium burning. We show that the updated reaction rates lead to modest but significant changes in full network, one-dimensional X-ray burst model calculations, compared with calculations with previously used reaction rate sets. The late time behavior of X-ray burst light curves shows significant changes, suggesting that the previously found small discrepancies between model calculations and observations may be solved with a better understanding of the nuclear input. Our X-ray burst model calculations are intended to serve as a benchmark for future model comparisons and sensitivity studies, as the complete underlying nuclear physics is fully documented and publicly available.},

abstract = {Context. Rotation is known to have a strong impact on the nucleosynthesis of light elements in massive stars, mainly by inducing mixing in radiative zones. In particular, rotation boosts the primary nitrogen production, and models of rotating stars are able to reproduce the nitrogen observed in low-metallicity halo stars. Aims: Here we present the first grid of stellar models for rotating massive stars at low metallicity, where a full s-process network is used to study the impact of rotation-induced mixing on the neutron capture nucleosynthesis of heavy elements. Methods: We used the Geneva stellar evolution code that includes an enlarged reaction network with nuclear species up to bismuth to calculate 25 M⊙ models at three different metallicities (Z = 10-3,10-5, and 10-7) and with different initial rotation rates. Results: First, we confirm that rotation-induced mixing (shear) between the convective H-shell and He-core leads to a large production of primary 22Ne (0.1 to 1% in mass fraction), which is the main neutron source for the s-process in massive stars. Therefore rotation boosts the s-process in massive stars at all metallicities. Second, the neutron-to-seed ratio increases with decreasing Z in models including rotation, which leads to the complete consumption of all iron seeds at metallicities below Z = 10-3 by the end of core He-burning. Thus at low Z, the iron seeds are the main limitation for this boosted s-process. Third, as the metallicity decreases, the production of elements up to the Ba peak increases at the expense of the elements of the Sr peak. We studied the impact of the initial rotation rate and of the highly uncertain 17O($\alpha$,$\gamma$) rate (which strongly affects the strength of 16O as a neutron poison) on our results. This study shows that rotating models can produce significant amounts of elements up to Ba over a wide range of Z, which has important consequences for our understanding of the formation of these elements in low-metallicity environments like the halo of our galaxy and globular clusters. Fourth, compared to the He-core, the primary 22Ne production induced by rotation in the He-shell is even higher (greater than 1% in mass fraction at all metallicities), which could open the door for an explosive neutron capture nucleosynthesis in the He-shell, with a primary neutron source.},

abstract = {We present new Keck/HIRES observations of six red giants in the globular cluster (GC) NGC 2419. Although the cluster is among the most distant and most luminous in the Milky Way, it was considered chemically ordinary until very recently. Our previous work showed that the near-infrared Ca II triplet line strength varied more than expected for a chemically homogeneous cluster, and that at least one star had unusual abundances of Mg and K. Here, we confirm that NGC 2419 harbors a population of stars, comprising about one-third of its mass, that is depleted in Mg by a factor of eight and enhanced in K by a factor of six with respect to the Mg-normal population. Although the majority, Mg-normal population appears to have a chemical abundance pattern indistinguishable from ordinary, inner-halo GCs, the Mg-poor population exhibits dispersions of several elements. The abundances of K and Sc are strongly anti-correlated with Mg, and some other elements (Si and Ca among others) are weakly anti-correlated with Mg. These abundance patterns suggest that the different populations of NGC 2419 sample the ejecta of diverse supernovae in addition to asymptotic giant branch ejecta. However, the abundances of Fe-peak elements except Sc show no star-to-star variation. We find no nucleosynthetic source that satisfactorily explains all of the abundance variations in this cluster. Because NGC 2419 appears like no other GC, we reiterate our previous suggestion that it is not a GC at all, but rather the core of an accreted dwarf galaxy.

Keck Observatory, which is operated jointly by the California Institute of Technology, the University of California, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.},

We find that, at the beginning of the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) phase, protons are ingested from the envelope in the underlying convective shell generated by the first fully developed thermal pulse. This peculiar phase is followed by a deep third dredge-up episode, which carries to the surface the freshly synthesized 13C, 14N and 7Li. A standard thermally pulsing AGB (TP-AGB) evolution then follows. During the proton-ingestion phase, a very high neutron density is attained and the s process is efficiently activated. We therefore adopt a nuclear network of about 700 isotopes, linked by more than 1200 reactions, and we couple it with the physical evolution of the model. We discuss in detail the evolution of the surface chemical composition, starting from the proton ingestion up to the end of the TP-AGB phase.},

The calculations have been conducted to determine whether an inner-shell convection zone that is driven outward from the center of the helium-burning shell by the flashes can penetrate into the hydrogen-rich zones of a star. Based on the present incomplete calculations, the process of flash evolution is outlined, the relationship between core mass and interflash period is described together with the relationship between core mass and intershell mass, and nucleosynthesis during helium-shell flash burning is considered. The results thus far indicate that the flashes increase in strength and consist of up to five subcomponents, the mass of the degenerate carbon-oxygen core may determine the interflash period as well as the intershell mass, and that helium flash burning produces mostly C-12 and a small amount of O-16.},

abstract = {Context. Very old halo stars have previously been found to show at least four different abundance anomalies, which models of fast-rotating massive stars (spinstars) can successfully account for: rise of N/O and C/O, low 12C/13C, and a primary-like evolution of Be and B. Here we show the impact of these same stars in the enrichment of Sr and Ba in the early Universe. Aims: We study whether the s-process production of fast-rotating massive stars can offer an explanation for the observed spread in [Sr/Ba] ratio in halo stars with metallicity [Fe/H] < -2.5. Methods: By means of a chemical inhomogeneous model, we computed the enrichment of Sr and Ba by massive stars in the Galactic halo. Our model takes, for the first time, the contribution of spinstars into account. Results: The model (combining an r-process contribution with an s-process from fast-rotating massive stars) is able to reproduce the observed scatter in the [Sr/Ba] ratio at [Fe/H] < -2.5. Toward higher metallicities, the stochasticity of the star formation fades away owing to the increasing number of exploding and enriching stars, and as a consequence the predicted scatter decreases. Conclusions: Our scenario is again based on the existence of spinstars in the early Universe. Very old halo stars have previously been found to show at least four other abundance anomalies, which rotating models of massive stars can successfully account for. Our results provide a fifth independent signature of fast-rotating massive stars: an early enrichment of the Universe in s-process elements.

Accurate iron, copper, and $\alpha$-element (Ca and Si) abundances have been derived and discussed. In particular, we have obtained the first direct abundance determination based on high-resolution spectroscopy for the RGB-a population, <[Fe/H]>=-0.60+/-0.15. Although this value is lower than previous estimates based on calcium triplet measurements, we confirm that this population is the most metal-rich in $\omega$ Cen. In addition, we have found a significant difference in the $\alpha$-element enhancement of the two populations. The three RGB-MInt stars have the expected overabundance, typical of halo and globular cluster stars: <[$\alpha$/Fe]>=0.29+/-0.01. The three RGB-a stars show, instead, a significantly lower $\alpha$-enhancement: <[$\alpha$/Fe]>=0.10+/-0.04. We have also detected an increasing trend of [Cu/Fe] with metallicity, similar to the one observed for field stars by Sneden et al. The observational facts presented in this Letter, if confirmed by larger samples of giants, are the first indication that supernovae Type Ia ejecta have contaminated the medium from which the metal-rich RGB-a stars have formed. The implications for current scenarios on the formation and evolution of $\omega$ Cen are briefly discussed.

abstract = {We present wide-field photometry of the Galactic globular cluster M22 in the B, V and I passbands for more than 186 000 stars. The study is complemented by the photometry in two narrow-band filters centred on H$\alpha$ and the adjacent continuum, and by infrared J, H and K magnitudes derived from the Two-Micron All-Sky Survey for {\textasciitilde}2000 stars. Profiting from this huge data base, we completely characterized the evolved stellar sequences of the cluster by determining a variety of photometric parameters, including new photometric estimates of the mean metallicity, reddening and distance to the cluster. In particular, from our multiwavelength analysis, we re-examined the long-standing metallicity spread problem in M22. According to our data set, we conclude that most of the observed width of the red giant branch must be due to differential reddening, which amounts to a maximum of $\Delta$E(B-V) {\textasciitilde}= 0.06, although the presence of a small metallicity spread cannot be completely ruled out. More specifically, the maximum metallicity spread allowed by our data is of the order of $\Delta$[Fe/H]{\textasciitilde}= 0.1-0.2 dex, i.e. not much more than that allowed by the photometric errors. Finally, we identified most of the known variable stars and peculiar objects in our field of view. In particular, we have found additional evidence supporting previous optical identifications of the central star of the planetary nebula IRAS 18333-2357, which is associated with M22.},

Spectroscopic factors were extracted for states corresponding to resonances in the 23Na (p,$\gamma$) 24Mg and 23Na (p,$\alpha$) 20Ne reactions. We find that one state, corresponding to a previously unobserved resonance at Ec.m. =138 keV , may make a significant contribution to the rates of both reactions at low temperatures. Another state, corresponding to a possible resonance at Ec.m. =37 keV may make a small contribution to the 23Na (p,$\alpha$) 20Ne reaction. New rates for the 23Na (p,$\gamma$) 24Mg and 23Na (p,$\alpha$) 20Ne reactions are presented and the astrophysical implications are discussed.},

abstract = {A linear [Fe/H]-[O/H] relation is found for different stellar populations in the Galaxy (halo, thick disk, thin disk) from a data sample obtained in a recent investigation (Ramirez et al. 2013). These correlations support previous results inferred from poorer samples: stars display a "main sequence" expressed as [Fe/H] = a[O/H]+b∓$\Delta$ b where the unit slope, a=1, implies a constant [O/Fe] abundance ratio. Oxygen and iron empirical abundance distributions are then determined for different subsamples, which are well explained by the theoretical predictions of multistage closed-(box+reservoir) (MCBR) chemical evolution models taking into account the found correlations. The interpretation of these distributions in the framework of MCBR models gives us clues about inflow/outflow rates in these different Galactic regions and their corresponding evolution. Outflow rates for the thick and the thin disks are lower than the halo outflow rate. Besides that, the iron-to-oxygen yield ratio and the primary to not primary contribution ratio for the iron production are obtained from the data, resulting consistent with the SNII progenitor nucleosynthesis and with the iron production from SNIa supernova events.},

These new data for Omega Cen, M5, and NGC 6752, together with existing data for M13, NGC 6397, and M71 were then employed to investigate any symptomatics of the cluster mass function slopes and their evolution. A related question also considered was the relation between the currently observed and the IMF slopes. While definitive answers regarding the evolution of globular cluster mass function slopes are not yet possible, mainly due to the small existing sample of observed mass functions extending down to low masses (M below 0.2 solar masses) and to restrictions in the theoretical modeling, certain trends are becoming apparent. In particular, it does appear that cluster evolution of stars has been important in modifying the cluster mass function slopes for at least two and possibly three of the clusters studied. A very important and quite robust result is that some (and perhaps all) clusters probably have very steep IMFs with the slope likely exceeding 2.5 (Salpeter value 1.3). This result suggests that low mass Population II stars may be an important component of the mass budget of the halo if the spheroid's mass function is similar to that seen in globular clusters.},

abstract = {Isotope ratios have opened a new window into the study of the details of stellar evolution, supernovae and galactic chemical evolution. We present the evolution of the isotope ratios of elemental abundances (from C to Zn) in the solar neighbourhood, bulge, halo and thick disc, using chemical evolution models with updated yields of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars and core-collapse supernovae. The evolutionary history of each element is different owing to the effects of the initial progenitor mass and metallicity on element production. In the bulge and thick disc the star formation time-scale is shorter than in the solar neighbourhood, leading to higher [$\alpha$/Fe] ratios. Likewise, the smaller contribution from Type Ia supernovae in these regions leads to lower [Mn/Fe] ratios. Also in the bulge, the abundances of [(Na, Al, P, Cl, K, Sc, Cu, Zn)/Fe] are higher because of the effect of metallicity on element production from core-collapse supernovae. According to our predictions, it is possible to find metal-rich stars ([Fe/H] ≳-1) that formed in the early Universe as a result of rapid star formation. The chemical enrichment time-scale of the halo is longer than in the solar neighbourhood, and consequently the ratios of [(C, F)/Fe] and 12C/13C are higher owing to a significant contribution from low-mass AGB stars. While the [$\alpha$/Fe] and [Mn/Fe] ratios are the same as in the solar neighbourhood, the [(Na, Al, P, Cl, K, Sc, Cu, Zn)/Fe] ratios are predicted to be lower. Furthermore, we predict that isotope ratios such as 24Mg/25, 26Mg are larger because of the contribution from low-metallicity supernovae. Using isotopic ratios, it is possible to select stars that formed in a system with a low chemical enrichment efficiency such as the satellite galaxies that were accreted on to our own Milky Way Galaxy.},

abstract = {We investigate the role of stellar axial rotation on the nitrogen nucleosynthesis at low metallicities Z. For this purpose, we have calculated models with initial masses between 2 and 60 Msun at Z=0.00001 from the zero age sequence to the phase of thermal pulses for models below or equal to 7 Msun, and up to the end of central C-burning for the more massive stars. The models include all the main physical effects of rotation. We show that intermediate mass stars with rotation naturally reproduce the occurrence and amount of primary nitrogen in the early star generations in the Universe. We identify two reasons why rotating models at low Z produce primary 14N: 1) Since the stars lose less angular momentum, they rotate faster. Simultaneously, they are more compact, thus differential rotation and shear mixing are stronger. 2) The H-burning shell has a much higher temperature and is thus closer to the core, which favours mixing between the two.},

abstract = {We study the effects of rotation on the structure and evolution of massive stars. The method of Kippenhahn {\&} Thomas (1970) to incorporate the hydrostatic effects of rotation in one dimensional stellar evolutionary codes is strictly valid only in case the angular velocity distribution has a cylindrical symmetry. We demonstrate how this method can be applied (cf. Appendix) in the case where the angular velocity is constant on isobars ("shellular rotation law", cf. Zahn 1992). We also investigate the structural effects of rotation on the stellar atmosphere. The effects of rotational mixing are considered with the theory of Zahn (1992) for the circulation and turbulence in rotating stars. We suppose that the angular momentum in a given shell remains constant with time (asymptotic regime). The subsequent developments brought to the Richardson criterion by Maeder (1995a) and Maeder and Meynet (1996) to account for thermal effects on the shear instability are also applied. Evolutionary tracks are calculated for initial masses of 9, 20, 40 and 60Msun_ with account of the above hydrostatic and mixing effects. The main results are the following ones: 1) The hydrostatic effects alone are quite modest: when the initial angular velocity ({OMEGA}) increases from 0 to 90% of the surface critical velocity ({OMEGA}_crit_), the lifetimes of massive star models (40 to 60Msun_) are increased by 1 to 2%. The evolutionary tracks are shifted towards lower luminosities, making them appear as the ones resulting from slightly lower initial mass stars, typically 0.5 to 2.5Msun_ smaller. 2) Surprisingly we find that the $\mu$-gradients, when non zero, are always strong enough to inhibit mixing. Indeed, the effects of $\mu$-gradients are quite difficult to overcome and this tends to make the rotationally induced mixing in-operant when the Richardson criterion is applied. 3) We suggest that different mixing criteria and/or diffusion coefficients must be searched for and applied if one wants to reproduce the observations by Herrero et al. (1992). Indeed these authors show that above a certain rotational velocity, quite efficient mixing processes are active and able to modify the surface abundances in helium during a fraction of the main sequence lifetime.},

abstract = {The production of 26Al in asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars is studied based on evolutionary stellar models of different masses (1.5 <= M/M\odot <= 6) and metallicities (0.004 <= Z <= 0.02). It is confirmed that 26Al is efficiently produced by hydrogen burning, but destruction of that nuclei by n-capture reactions during the interpulse and pulse phases becomes increasingly more efficient as the star evolves on the AGB. The amount of 26Al available in the intershell region follows, at a given metallicity, a very well defined pattern as a function of the H-burning shell temperature TH. Two zones must be distinguished. The first one comprises those He-rich layers containing H-burning ashes which escape pulse in jection. The amount of 26Al in that zone (M\odot1-2{\texttimes}10-7 at the first pulse in M\odot1.5-3 Z=0.02 stars) steadily decreases with pulse number. Its contribution to the surface 26Al enhancement can only be important during the first pulses if dredge--up occurs at that stage. The second zone consists of the C-rich material emerging from the pulses. The amount of 26Al available in that zone is higher than that in the first zone (M\odot3-4{\texttimes}10-7 at the first pulse in M\odot1.5-3 Z=0.02 stars), and keeps constant during about the first dozen pulses before decreasing when TH{\textasciitilde}> 55{\texttimes} 106 K. This zone is thus an important potential reservoir for surface 26Al enrichment. Using third dredge-up (3DUP) efficiencies from model calculations, the surface 26Al abundance is predicted to reach 1-2{\texttimes} 10-7 mass fractions in our low-mass solar metallicity stars, with an uncertainty factor of about three. It decreases with increasing stellar mass, being about three times lower in a M\odot4 than in M\odot2-3 stars. In massive AGB stars, however, hot bottom burning enables to easily reach surface 26Al mass fractions above 10-6. The 26Al/27Al ratios measured in meteoritic SiC and oxide grains are discussed, as well as that possibly measured in the nearby C-star IRC+10216. We also address the contribution of AGB stars to the 2-3 M\odot present day mass of 26Al detected in the Galaxy. Finally, we discuss the possibility of directly detecting an AGB star or a planetary nebula as a single source at 1.8 MeV with the future INTEGRAL satellite.},

abstract = {We present a framework that explains the commonly observed variation in light element abundances in globular clusters. If globular clusters form in the centres of dwarf galaxies, they will be pumped on to larger orbits as star formation progresses. The potential well will only retain the moderate velocity asymptotic giant branch (AGB) ejecta, the expected source of enrichment, but not supernova ejecta. There is no need to increase the initial cluster mass, a requirement of self-enrichment scenarios, as all the stars within the dwarf can contribute. As the clusters move through the dwarf centre they sweep up a mix of AGB ejecta and in-falling pristine gas to form a second generation of stars. The specific mix will vary in time and is thus able to explain the spread in second generation abundances observed in different clusters. The globular clusters will survive to the present day or be stripped as part of the hierarchical merging process of larger galaxies. We illustrate how this process may operate using a high-resolution simulation of a dwarf galaxy at high redshift.},

Modern large telescopes discovered galaxies at redshifts greater than seven, whereas theoretical studies have just reached the degree of sophistication necessary to make meaningful predictions. A crucial ingredient is the feedback exerted by the first generation of stars, through UV radiation, supernova blast waves, and chemical enrichment. The key goal is to derive the signature of the first galaxies to be observed with upcoming or planned next-generation facilities, such as the James Webb Space Telescope or Atacama Large Millimeter Array. From the observational side, ongoing deep-field searches for very high-redshift galaxies begin to provide us with empirical constraints on the nature of the first galaxies.},

abstract = {We present the results of a 10.5-yr, volume-limited (28-Mpc) search for supernova (SN) progenitor stars. In doing so we compile all SNe discovered within this volume (132, of which 27 per cent are Type Ia) and determine the relative rates of each subtype from literature studies. The core-collapse SNe break down into 59 per cent II-P and 29 per cent Ib/c, with the remainder being IIb (5 per cent), IIn (4 per cent) and II-L (3 per cent). There have been 20 II-P SNe with high-quality optical or near-infrared pre-explosion images that allow a meaningful search for the progenitor stars. In five cases they are clearly red supergiants, one case is unconstrained, two fall on compact coeval star clusters and the other twelve have no progenitor detected. We review and update all the available data for the host galaxies and SN environments (distance, metallicity and extinction) and determine masses and upper mass estimates for these 20 progenitor stars using the STARS stellar evolutionary code and a single consistent homogeneous method. A maximum likelihood calculation suggests that the minimum stellar mass for a Type II-P to form is mmin = 8.5+1-1.5Msolar and the maximum mass for II-P progenitors is mmax = 16.5 +/- 1.5Msolar, assuming a Salpeter initial mass function holds for the progenitor population (in the range $\Gamma$ = -1.35+0.3-0.7). The minimum mass is consistent with current estimates for the upper limit to white dwarf progenitor masses, but the maximum mass does not appear consistent with massive star populations in Local Group galaxies. Red supergiants in the Local Group have masses up to 25Msolar and the minimum mass to produce a Wolf-Rayet star in single star evolution (between solar and LMC metallicity) is similarly 25-30Msolar. The reason we have not detected any high-mass red supergiant progenitors above 17Msolar is unclear, but we estimate that it is statistically significant at 2.4$\sigma$ confidence. Two simple reasons for this could be that we have systematically underestimated the progenitor masses due to dust extinction or that stars between 17-25Msolar produce other kinds of SNe which are not II-P. We discuss these possibilities and find that neither provides a satisfactory solution. We term this discrepancy the `red supergiant problem' and speculate that these stars could have core masses high enough to form black holes and SNe which are too faint to have been detected. We compare the 56Ni masses ejected in the SNe to the progenitor mass estimates and find that low-luminosity SNe with low 56Ni production are most likely to arise from explosions of low-mass progenitors near the mass threshold that can produce a core-collapse.},

Furthermore, we derive the abundance pattern of the LEPP from observation and show that it is consistent with a missing component in the solar abundances when using a recent s-process model. As the astrophysical site of the LEPP is not known, we explore the possibility of a neutron-capture process within a site-independent approach.

abstract = {The main effect of axial rotation on the evolution of massive PopIII stars is to trigger internal mixing processes which allow stars to produce significant amounts of primary nitrogen 14 and carbon 13. Very metal poor massive stars produce much more primary nitrogen than PopIII stars for a given initial mass and rotation velocity. The very metal poor stars undergo strong mass loss induced by rotation. One can distinguish two types of rotationnaly enhanced stellar winds: 1) Rotationally mechanical winds occurs when the surface velocity reaches the critical velocity at the equator, i.e. the velocity at which the centrifugal acceleration is equal to the gravity; 2) Rotationally radiatively line driven winds are a consequence of strong internal mixing which brings large amounts of CNO elements at the surface. This enhances the opacity and may trigger strong line driven winds. These effects are important for an initial value of $\upsilon$/$\upsilon$crit of 0.54 for a 60 Msolar at Z = 10-8, i.e. for initial values of $\upsilon$/$\upsilon$crit higher than the one ({\textasciitilde}0.4) corresponding to observations at solar Z. These two effects, strong internal mixing leading to the synthesis of large amounts of primary nitrogen and important mass losses induced by rotation, occur for Z between about 10-8 and 0.001. For metallicities above 0.001 and for reasonable choice of the rotation velocities, internal mixing is no longer efficient enough to trigger these effects.},

abstract = {Stellar evolution theory predicts that asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars undergo a series of short thermal pulses that significantly change their luminosity and mass on timescales of hundreds to thousands of years. These pulses are confirmed observationally by the existence of the short-lived radioisotope technetium in the spectra of some of these stars, but other observational consequences of thermal pulses are subtle and may only be detected over many years of observations. Secular changes in these stars resulting from thermal pulses can be detected as measurable changes in period if the star is undergoing Mira pulsations. It is known that a small fraction of Mira variables exhibit large secular period changes, and the detection of these changes among a larger sample of stars could therefore be useful in evolutionary studies of these stars. The American Association of Variable Star Observers (AAVSO) International Database currently contains visual data for over 1500 Mira variables. Light curves for these stars span nearly a century in some cases, making it possible to study the secular evolution of the pulsation behavior on these timescales. In this paper we present the results of our study of period change in 547 Mira variables using data from the AAVSO. We use wavelet analysis to measure the period changes in individual Mira stars over the span of available data. By making linear fits to the period versus time measurements, we determine the average rates of period change, dlnP/dt, for each of these stars. We find nonzero dlnP/dt at the 2 $\sigma$ significance level in 57 of the 547 stars, at the 3 $\sigma$ level in 21 stars, and at the level of 6 $\sigma$ or greater in eight stars. The latter eight stars have been previously noted in the literature, and our derived rates of period change largely agree with published values. The largest and most statistically significant dlnP/dt are consistent with the rates of period change expected during thermal pulses on the AGB. A number of other stars exhibit nonmonotonic period change on decades-long timescales, the cause of which is not yet known. In the majority of stars, the period variations are smaller than our detection threshold, meaning the available data are not sufficient to unambiguously measure slow evolutionary changes in the pulsation period. It is unlikely that more stars with large period changes will be found among heretofore well-observed Mira stars in the short term, but continued monitoring of these and other Mira stars may reveal new and serendipitous candidates in the future.},

abstract = {We discuss abundances of O, Na, and Al, as a function of (Fe/H), together with their interrelationships, from a high-dispersion, high signal-to-noise analysis of a (biased) sample of 40 red giants in the chemically inhomogeneous cluster omega Centauri. Accompanying the well-established range in (Fe/H), which in our sample extends from -1.8 to -0.8, we find large variations of O, Na, and Al. At (Fe/H) approximately -1.5, for example, Delta(O/Fe) greater than 0.9, Delta(Na/Fe) approximately 0.6, and Delta(Al/Fe) approximately 1.1. More important, there are strong (Na/Fe), (O/Fe) and (Al/Fe), (O/Fe) anticorrelations, and a strong positive correlation between (Na/Fe) and (Al/Fe). The simplest explanation of these relationships is that they are produced by evolutionary mixing effects as suggested by Denisenkov {\&} Denisenkova in the context of earlier observations of this cluster and elaborated upon by Langer, Hoffman, {\&} Sneden for more normal ones. We comment on the importance of the relative sizes of the ranges of intracluster Na and Al variations as a possible diagnostic of putative mixing phenomena.},

abstract = {The strontium, zirconium, molybdenum, and barium isotopic compositions predicted in the mass-losing envelopes of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars of solar metallicity and mass 1.5, 3, and 5 Msolar are discussed and compared with recent measurements in single presolar silicon carbide (SiC) grains from the Murchison meteorite. Heavy-element nucleosynthesis via the s-process occurs in the helium intershell, the region between the helium-burning and hydrogen-burning shells, producing heavy elements beyond iron. After a limited number of thermal runaways of the helium shell (thermal pulses), at the quenching of each instability, the convective envelope penetrates into the top layers of the helium intershell (third dredge-up), mixing newly synthesized 12C and s-process material to the stellar surface. Eventually, the envelope becomes carbon-rich (C>=O), a necessary condition for SiC grains to condense. In the helium intershell, neutrons are released by ($\alpha$, n) reactions on 13C and 22Ne during interpulse phases and the thermal pulses, respectively. A 13C pocket is assumed to form in a tiny region in the top layers of the helium intershell by injection of a small amount of protons from the envelope during each third dredge-up episode. This 13C then burns radiately during the interpulse phase. The average neutron density produced is low, but of long duration, so the total neutron exposure is high. We have explored a large range of possible 13C abundances in the pocket. In low-mass AGB stars (1.5Msolar<=M<=4 Msolar), a second small burst of neutrons is released by marginal 22Ne burning in the thermal pulse. The neutron density reaches quite a high peak value but is of short duration, so the neutron exposure is low. In intermediate-mass AGB stars (4Msolar<M<=8 Msolar), the 22Ne neutron source is more efficiently activated. The neutron capture process has been followed with a postprocessing code that considers all relevant nuclei from 4He to 210Po. The predicted isotopic compositions of strontium, zirconium, molybdenum, and barium in the envelopes of low-mass AGB stars of solar metallicity are in agreement with the isotopic ratios measured in individual presolar SiC grains, whereas predictions for intermediate-mass stars exclude them as the sources of these grains. A multiplicity of low-mass AGB stars with metallicity around solar, having different masses and experiencing different neutron exposures, are required to account for the measured spread in heavy-element isotopic compositions among single presolar SiC grains. The range of neutron exposures corresponds, on average, to a lower mean neutron exposure than that required to reproduce the s-process main component in the solar system.},

abstract = {Context: Technetium (Tc) is an unstable element synthesised via the s-process in deep layers of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, making it a reliable indicator of both recent s-process activity and third dredge-up. Aims: We searched for Tc in a sample of bright oxygen-rich asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars located in the outer galactic bulge. We test theoretical predictions of the luminosity limit for the onset of third dredge-up. Methods: Using high-resolution optical spectra obtained with the UVES spectrograph at ESO's VLT, we searched for resonance lines of neutral Tc in the blue spectral region of our sample stars. These measurements allow us to improve the procedure of classification of stars with respect to their Tc content by using flux ratios. Synthetic spectra based on MARCS atmospheric models are presented and compared to the observed spectra around three lines of Tc. Bolometric magnitudes are calculated based on the near-infrared photometry of the objects. Results: Among the sample of 27 long-period bulge variables, four were found to definitely contain Tc in their atmospheres. The luminosity of the Tc-rich stars agrees with predictions from AGB evolutionary models on the minimum luminosity at the time when third dredge-up sets in. However, AGB evolutionary models and a bulge consisting of a single old population cannot be brought into agreement. This probably means that a younger population is present in the bulge, as suggested by various authors, that contains the Tc-rich stars identified here.

abstract = {We investigate the effects of molecular opacities on the evolution of TP-AGB stars that experience the third dredge-up, i.e. with surface abundances of carbon and oxygen varying with time. To this aim, a routine is constructed to derive the molecular concentrations through dissociation equilibrium calculations, and estimate the opacities due to H2, H2O, OH, C2, CN, and CO for any given density, temperature and chemical composition of the gas. Then, synthetic TP-AGB models with dredge-up are calculated by either adopting the newly developed routine, or interpolating between fixed opacity tables for solar chemical composition. The comparison between the two cases shows that the change in the dominant opacity sources, as the C/O ratio grows from below to above unity, crucially affects the evolution of the effective temperature, i.e. causing a notable cooling of the carbon-rich models (with C/O>1). From the comparison with observational data, it turns out that TP-AGB models with variable molecular opacities are able to reproduce the observed range of effective temperatures, mass-loss rates, and wind expansion velocities of C-type giants in the solar neighbourhood, otherwise failed if assuming fixed molecular opacities for solar-scaled mixtures. Finally, we mention other possibly important evolutionary and observational effects that result from the adoption of the variable opacities, such as: i) significant shortening of the C-star phase due to the earlier onset of the super-wind; ii) consequent reduction of the carbon yields iii) reproduction of the observed range of near-infrared colours of C-stars.},

Classified well before maximum light, LSQ12gdj has extinction-corrected absolute magnitude MB = -19.8, and pre-maximum spectroscopic evolution similar to SN 1991T and the super-Chandrasekhar-mass SN 2007if. We use ultraviolet photometry from Swift, ground-based optical photometry, and corrections from a near-infrared photometric template to construct the bolometric (1600-23 800 {\AA}) light curve out to 45 d past B-band maximum light. We estimate that LSQ12gdj produced 0.96 {\textpm} 0.07 M⊙ of 56Ni, with an ejected mass near or slightly above the Chandrasekhar mass. As much as 27 per cent of the flux at the earliest observed phases, and 17 per cent at maximum light, is emitted bluewards of 3300 {\AA}. The absence of excess luminosity at late times, the cutoff of the spectral energy distribution bluewards of 3000 {\AA} and the absence of narrow line emission and strong Na I D absorption all argue against a significant contribution from ongoing shock interaction. However, {\~{ }}10 per cent of LSQ12gdj's luminosity near maximum light could be produced by the release of trapped radiation, including kinetic energy thermalized during a brief interaction with a compact, hydrogen-poor envelope (radius <1013 cm) shortly after explosion; such an envelope arises generically in double-degenerate merger scenarios.},

abstract = {The primordial abundance of deuterium produced during Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) depends sensitively on the universal ratio of baryons to photons, an important cosmological parameter probed independently by the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation. Observations of deuterium in high-redshift, low-metallicity QSO Absorption Line Systems (QSOALS) provide a key baryometer, determining the baryon abundance at the time of BBN to a precision of {\textasciitilde}5%. Alternatively, if the CMB-determined baryon to photon ratio is used in the BBN calculation of the primordial abundances, the BBN-predicted deuterium abundance may be compared with the primordial value inferred from the QSOALS, testing the standard cosmological model. In the post-BBN universe, as gas is cycled through stars, deuterium is only destroyed so that its abundance measured anytime, anywhere in the Universe, bounds the primordial abundance from below. Constraints on models of post-BBN Galactic chemical evolution follow from a comparison of the relic deuterium abundance with the FUSE-inferred deuterium abundances in the chemically enriched, stellar processed material of the local ISM.},

This work is motivated by the insufficiently understood observed consequences of the H-ingestion flash in post-asymptotic giant branch (post-AGB) stars (Sakurai's object) and metal-poor AGB stars. Our investigation is focused on the entrainment process at the top convection boundary and on the subsequent advection of H-rich material into deeper layers, and we therefore ignore the burning of the proton-rich fuel in this study. We find that for our deep convection zone, coherent convective motions of near global scale appear to dominate the flow. At the top boundary convective shear flows are stable against Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities. However, such shear instabilities are induced by the boundary-layer separation in large-scale, opposing flows. This links the global nature of thick shell convection with the entrainment process. We establish the quantitative dependence of the entrainment rate on grid resolution. With our numerical technique, simulations with 10243 cells or more are required to reach a numerical fidelity appropriate for this problem. However, only the result from the 15363 simulation provides a clear indication that we approach convergence with regard to the entrainment rate. Our results demonstrate that our method, which is described in detail, can provide quantitative results related to entrainment and convective boundary mixing in deep stellar interior environments with very stiff convective boundaries. For the representative case we study in detail, we find an entrainment rate of 4.38 {\textpm} 1.48 {\texttimes} 10-13 M ⊙ s-1.},

abstract = {The globular cluster M2 has a photometrically detected double red giant branch (RGB) sequence. We investigate here the chemical differences between the two RGBs in order to gain insight in the star formation history of this cluster. The low-resolution spectra, covering the blue spectral range, were collected with the Multi-Object Double CCD Spectrograph (MODS) on the Large Binocular Telescope, and analysed via spectrum synthesis technique. The high quality of the spectra allows us to measure C, N, Ba and Sr abundances relative to iron for 15 RGB stars distributed along the two sequences. We add to the MODS sample C and N measurements for 35 additional stars belonging to the blue RGB sequence, presented in Lardo et al. We find a clear separation between the two groups of stars in s-process elements as well as C and N content. Both groups display a C-N anticorrelation and the red RGB stars are on average richer in C and N with respect to the blue RGB. Our results reinforce the suggestion that M2 belongs to the family of globular clusters with complex star formation history, together with $\omega$ Cen, NGC 1851 and M22.},

abstract = {We model the nucleosynthesis during the thermal pulse phase of a rotating, solar metallicity, asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star of 3 Msolar, which was evolved from a main-sequence model rotating with 250 km s-1 at the stellar equator. Rotationally induced mixing during the thermal pulses produces a layer ({\textasciitilde}2{\texttimes}10-5 Msolar) on top of the CO core where large amounts of protons and 12C coexist. With a postprocessing nucleosynthesis and mixing code, we follow the abundance evolution in this layer, in particular that of the neutron source 13C and of the neutron poison 14N. In our AGB model mixing persists during the entire interpulse phase because of the steep angular velocity gradient at the core-envelope interface, thereby spreading 14N over the entire 13C-rich part of the layer. We follow the neutron production during the interpulse phase and find a resulting maximum neutron exposure of $\tau$max=0.04 mbarn-1, which is too small to produce any significant s-process. In parametric models, we then investigate the combined effects of diffusive overshooting from the convective envelope and rotationally induced mixing. Just adding the overshooting and leaving the rotational mixing unchanged results in a small maximum neutron exposure (0.03 mbarn-1). Models with overshoot and weaker interpulse mixing-as perhaps expected from more slowly rotating stars-yield larger neutron exposures. In a model with overshooting without any interpulse mixing a neutron exposure of up to 0.72 mbarn-1 is obtained, which is larger than required by observations. We conclude that the incorporation of rotationally induced mixing processes has important consequences for the production of heavy elements in AGB stars. While through a distribution of initial rotation rates, it may lead to a natural spread in the neutron exposures obtained in AGB stars of a given mass in general-as appears to be required by observations-it may moderate the large neutron exposures found in models with diffusive overshoot in particular. Our results suggest that both processes, diffusive overshoot and rotational mixing, may be required to obtain a consistent description of the s-process in AGB stars that fulfills all observational constraints. Finally, we find that mixing due to rotation within our current framework does increase the production of 15N in the partial mixing zone. However, this increase is not large enough to boost the production of fluorine to the level required by observations.},

abstract = {One of the largest sources of uncertainty in the computation of globular cluster isochrones and hence in the age determination of globular clusters is the lack of a rigorous description of convection. Therefore, we calibrated the superadiabatic temperature gradient in the envelope of metal-poor low-mass stars according to the results from a new grid of two-dimensional hydrodynamical models, which cover the main sequence and the lower red giant branch of globular cluster stars. In practice, we still use for computing the evolutionary stellar models the traditional mixing-length formalism, but we fix the mixing-length parameter $\alpha$ in order to reproduce the run of the entropy of the deeper adiabatic region of the stellar envelopes with effective temperature and gravity as obtained from the hydrodynamical models. The detailed behavior of the calibrated $\alpha$ depends in a nontrivial way on the effective temperature, gravity, and metallicity of the star. Nevertheless, the resulting isochrones for the relevant age range of Galactic globular clusters have only small differences with respect to isochrones computed adopting a constant solar calibrated value of the mixing length. Accordingly, the age of globular clusters is reduced by 0.2 Gyr at most.},

abstract = {An analytical-numerical study is made of the thermally driven meridional currents and concomitant differential rotation in the radiative envelope of a nonmagnetic, early-type star. Since we cannot possibly encompass all the timescales and space scales of motion in a star, we make use of steady state models to represent these large-scale motions, while applying parametric expressions to describe the effects of all smaller scales. Assuming that the departures from spherical symmetry are not too large, we expand the solutions about hydrostatic equilibrium in powers of the rotational parameter e, which is the ratio of the centrifugal force to gravity at the equator. Thence, by making allowance for turbulent friction acting on the mean flow (i.e., the differential rotation and the meridional currents), we obtain second-order solutions in e that satisfy all the basic equations and all the boundary conditions. As a matter of fact, there exist thin thermoviscous boundary layers, so that the currents do not become infinite near the boundaries, the meridional velocities remaining uniformly small throughout the radiative envelope. Simultaneously, the frictional force acting on the differential rotation can be made to balance the transport of angular momentum by the large-scale meridional flow. The proposed solution is a diffusive one, in the sense that the effects of vertical dissipation are assumed to be larger than those caused by the thermally driven currents. Detailed solutions have been obtained in the case when the basic state of motion is a uniform, or almost uniform, rotation. Neglecting turbulent friction altogether, one always obtains 1/$\rho$ singularities in the second-order corrections for the r- and $\theta$-components of the circulation velocity u. Strict solid-body rotation to order e1/2 is not an admissible solution, therefore, since the second-order terms may dominate over the first-order ones in the outermost surface layers. On the contrary, in the case of almost uniform rotation to order e1/2, one finds 1/$\rho$ singularities to all orders (i.e., e and e2) in the inviscid part of the solution for the meridional flow. Hence, by making allowance for turbulent friction in the surface layers, one can obtain self-consistent solutions in these regions. Owing to the presence of the 1/$\rho$ terms in the inviscid solution, the radial component ur at first increases toward the surface, then drops rapidly to zero at the outer boundary. In agreement with the prediction made by Baker {\&} Kippenhahn, there is indeed an intensification of the meridional flow near the surface. However, it is shown that the frictional force acting on the circulatory currents prevents huge surface velocities. Typically, one finds that |ur| ≲ 1 cm s-1 and |u$\theta$| ≲ 102 cm s-1 near the surface of a 3 Msun star, which is a long remove from the evaluations based on the inadequate formulae ur $\propto$ e/$\rho$ or ur $\propto$ e2/$\rho$. It is also found that the topology of the circulatory currents in the surface layers is quite dependent on the gradient of angular velocity in these regions. Assuming almost solid-body rotation to order e1/2, we demonstrate that the meridional flow in a very slow rotator may consist either of a single cell or of two distinct cells. For moderate or large rotation rates, it consists of two or even three distinct cells the exact location of their separation in the latter case depending on the magnitude and spatial variations of the basic rotation law. This is completely different from the Gratton-{\"O}pik double-cell pattern, which is not observed in our self-consistent, second-order solutions. As a sideline, we demonstrate that their double-cell pattern is the result of at least one of the following causes: (1) an overabundance of conflicting assumptions in the model, (2) a mathematical divergence of the expansions, (3) an inadequate separation of r and $\theta$ in the expansions, or (4) demonstrable algebraic errors. To sum up, we have shown that Sweet's original solution is remarkably successful in describing the thermally driven currents in the deep interior of a stellar radiative envelope in almost uniform rotation. Near the lower boundary, however, there exists a thin thermoviscous boundary layer that allows the meridional velocity to make a smooth transition to the value prescribed at the convective core. His inviscid solution must be amended in the surface layers also, since one always finds a slight intensification of the currents in these low-density regions. Again, there exists a thin thermoviscous boundary layer that acts to satisfy the surface boundary conditions while preventing huge meridional velocities in the region where a double-cell pattern may occur. Unfortunately, because it is impossible at this time to perform a meaningful evaluation of the eddy viscosities, we cannot calculate the small departures from solid-body rotation with any accuracy.},

abstract = {NGC 1851 is surrounded by a stellar component that extends more than 10 times beyond the tidal radius. Although the nature of this stellar structure is not known, it has been suggested to be a sparse halo of stars or associated with a stellar stream. We analyse the nature of this intriguing stellar component surrounding NGC 1851 by investigating its radial velocities and chemical composition, in particular in comparison with those of the central cluster analysed in a homogeneous manner. In total we observed 23 stars in the halo with radial velocities consistent with NGC 1851, and for 15 of them we infer [Fe/H] abundances. Our results show that (i) stars dynamically linked to NGC 1851 are present at least up to {\~{ }}2.5 tidal radii, supporting the presence of a halo of stars surrounding the cluster; (ii) apart from the NGC 1851 radial velocity-like stars, our observed velocity distribution agrees with that expected from Galactic models, suggesting that no other substructure (such as a stream) at different radial velocities is present in our field; (iii) the chemical abundances for the s-process elements Sr and Ba are consistent with the s-normal stars observed in NGC 1851; (iv) all halo stars have metallicities, and abundances for the other studied elements Ca, Mg and Cr, consistent with those exhibited by the cluster. The complexity of the whole NGC 1851 cluster+halo system may agree with the scenario of a tidally disrupted dwarf galaxy in which NGC 1851 was originally embedded.},

abstract = {Detailed chemical abundances are presented for seven M31 outer halo globular clusters (with projected distances from M31 greater than 30 kpc), as derived from high-resolution integrated light spectra taken with the Hobby-Eberly Telescope. Five of these clusters were recently discovered in the Pan-Andromeda Archaeological Survey (PAndAS) - this paper presents the first determinations of integrated Fe, Na, Mg, Ca, Ti, Ni, Ba, and Eu abundances for these clusters. Four of the target clusters (PA06, PA53, PA54, and PA56) are metal poor ([Fe/H] < -1.5), $\alpha$-enhanced (though they are possibly less $\alpha$-enhanced than Milky Way stars at the 1$\sigma$ level), and show signs of star-to-star Na and Mg variations. The other three globular clusters (H10, H23, and PA17) are more metal rich, with metallicities ranging from [Fe/H] = -1.4 to -0.9. While H23 is chemically similar to Milky Way field stars, Milky Way globular clusters, and other M31 clusters, H10 and PA17, have moderately low [Ca/Fe], compared to Milky Way field stars and clusters. Additionally, PA17's high [Mg/Ca] and [Ba/Eu] ratios are distinct from Milky Way stars, and are in better agreement with the stars and clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud. None of the clusters studied here can be conclusively linked to any of the identified streams from PAndAS; however, based on their locations, kinematics, metallicities, and detailed abundances, the most metal-rich PAndAS clusters H23 and PA17 may be associated with the progenitor of the Giant Stellar Stream, H10 may be associated with the SW cloud, and PA53 and PA56 may be associated with the eastern cloud.},

abstract = {There is increasing evidence that low-mass stars with circumstellar disks can be born close to massive stars, in some cases within tenths of a parsec. If the disks have lifetimes greater than those of the more massive stars, they are exposed to radiation fields and gas flows from the late evolutionary phases and supernovae of the massive stars. The fast flows from supernovae are likely to give some stripping of mass from the disks but do not typically lead to complete disruption of the disks. In the slow wind from a red supergiant star, there is the possibility of gravitational accretion of wind matter onto the circumstellar disk. In the supernova explosion of a red supergiant, the radiative flux at the time of shock breakout can heat and ionize a nearby disk, leading to transient, narrow-line emission. There are consequences for the solar nebula if it was born {\textasciitilde}0.2 pc from a massive star that became a red supergiant. Accretion from the wind could supply a substantial amount of 26Al to the disk. The high radiative luminosity of the eventual supernova could lead to the melting of dust grains and the formation of chondrules. The passage of the supernova ejecta could drive a shock wave in the disk, heating it.},

abstract = {We study the ages of $\alpha$-rich and $\alpha$-poor stars in the halo using a sample of F and G dwarfs from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). To separate stars based on [$\alpha$/Fe], we have developed a new semi-empirical spectral index-based method and applied it to the low-resolution, moderate signal-to-noise SDSS spectra. The method can be used to estimate the [$\alpha$/Fe] directly providing a new and widely applicable way to estimate [$\alpha$/Fe] from low-resolution spectra. We measured the main-sequence turnoff temperature and combined it with the metallicities and a set of isochrones to estimate the age of the $\alpha$-rich and $\alpha$-poor populations in our sample. We found all stars appear to be older than 8 Gyr confirming the idea that the Galactic halo was formed very early on. A bifurcation appears in the age-metallicity relation such that in the low-metallicity regime the $\alpha$-rich and $\alpha$-poor populations are coeval while in the high-metallicity regime the $\alpha$-rich population is older than the $\alpha$-poor population. Our results indicate the $\alpha$-rich halo population, which has shallow age-metallicity relation, was formed in a rapid event with high star formation, while the $\alpha$-poor stars were formed in an environment with a slower chemical evolution time-scale.},

abstract = {In the course of a systematic exploration of the uncertainties associated with the input micro- and macro-physics in the modeling of the evolution of intermediate mass stars during their Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) phase, we focus on the role of the nuclear reactions rates and mass loss. We consider masses 3$\le$ M/M_{\&}sun; $\le$ 6.5 for a metallicity typical for globular clusters, Z=0.001, and compare the results obtained by computing the full nucleosynthesis with hot bottom burning (HBB), for a network of 30 elements, using either the NACRE or the Cameron {\&} Fowler (CF88) cross-sections. The results differ in particular with respect to the 23Na nucleosynthesis (which is more efficient in the NACRE case) and the magnesium isotopes ratios. For both choices, however, the CNO nucleosynthesis shows that the C+N+O is constant within a factor of two, in our models employing a very efficient convection treatment. Different mass loss rates alter the physical conditions for HBB and the length of the AGB phase, indirectly changing the chemical yields. These computations show that the predictive power of our AGB models is undermined by these uncertainties. In particular, it appears at the moment very difficult to strongly accept or dismiss that these sources play a key-role in the pollution of Globular Clusters (GCs), and that they have been the main stellar site responsible for the chemical anomalies that are observed at the surface of giant and turn-off stars of GCs, in the self-enrichment scenarios.},

The lecture was conceived for students not yet familiar with advanced physics and is suitable for those studying several other disciplines. The Higgs mechanism is introduced through semi-classical arguments mimicking basic field-theory concepts, assuming the validity of a symmetry principle in the expression of the energy of particles in a classical field. The lecture is divided into two parts. The first, suitable even for high-school students, shows how the mass of a particle results from a dynamical effect caused by interaction between a massless particle and a field (as in the Higgs mechanism). The audience for the second, much more technical part consists mainly of teachers and university students from disciplines other than physics.},

abstract = {We calculate a grid of models with and without the effects of axial rotation for massive stars in the range of 9 to 60 Msun and metallicity Z = 0.004 appropriate for the SMC. Remarkably, the ratios Omega /Omega crit of the angular velocity to the break-up angular velocity grow strongly during the evolution of high mass stars, contrary to the situation at Z = 0.020. The reason is that at low Z, mass loss is smaller and the removal of angular momentum during evolution much weaker, also there is an efficient outward transport of angular momentum by meridional circulation. Thus, a much larger fraction of the stars at lower Z reach break-up velocities and rotation may thus be a dominant effect at low Z. The models with rotation well account for the long standing problem of the large numbers of red supergiants observed in low Z galaxies, while current models with mass loss were predicting no red supergiants. We discuss in detail the physical effects of rotation which favour a redwards evolution in the HR diagram. The models also predict large N enrichments during the evolution of high mass stars. The predicted relative N-enrichments are larger at Z lower than solar and this is in very good agreement with the observations for A-type supergiants in the SMC.},

These yields are evaluated by using them in a Galaxy Chemical Evolution model, with which we analyze the evolution of carbon abundances. By comparing the results with those obtained with other yield sets, and with a large amount of observational data, we conclude that the model using these yields combined with those from [CITE] for massive stars properly reproduce all the data. The model reproduces well the increase of C/O with increasing O/H abundances. Since these massive star yields do not include winds, it implies that these stellar winds might have a smoother dependence on metallicity than usually assumed and that a significant quantity of carbon proceeds from LIM stars.

abstract = {We present theoretical delay times and rates of thermonuclear explosions that are thought to produce Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), including the double-detonation sub-Chandrasekhar mass model, using the population synthesis binary evolution code STARTRACK. If detonations of sub-Chandrasekhar mass carbon-oxygen white dwarfs following a detonation in an accumulated layer of helium on the white dwarf's surface ('double-detonation' models) are able to produce thermonuclear explosions which are characteristically similar to those of SNe Ia, then these sub-Chandrasekhar mass explosions may account for at least some substantial fraction of the observed SN Ia rate. Regardless of whether all double-detonations look like 'normal' SNe Ia, in any case the explosions are expected to be bright and thus potentially detectable. Additionally, we find that the delay time distribution of double-detonation sub-Chandrasekhar mass SNe Ia can be divided into two distinct formation channels: the 'prompt' helium-star channel with delay times <500 Myr (13 per cent of all sub-Chandras), and the 'delayed' double white dwarf channel, with delay times ≳ 800 Myr spanning up to a Hubble time (87 per cent). These findings coincide with recent observationally derived delay time distributions which have revealed that a large number of SNe Ia are prompt with delay times <500 Myr, while a significant fraction also have delay times spanning {\~{ }}1 Gyr to a Hubble time.},

abstract = {Context. Numerous spectroscopic observations provide compelling evidence for non-canonical processes that modify the surface abundances of low- and intermediate-mass stars beyond the predictions of standard stellar theory. Aims: We study the effects of thermohaline instability and rotation-induced mixing in the 1-4 M⊙ range at solar metallicity. Methods: We present evolutionary models by considering both thermohaline and rotation-induced mixing in stellar interior. We discuss the effects of these processes on the chemical properties of stars from the zero age main sequence up to the end of the second dredge-up on the early-AGB for intermediate-mass stars and up to the AGB tip for low-mass stars. Model predictions are compared to observational data for lithium, 12C/13C, [N/C], [Na/Fe], 16O/17O, and 16O/18O in Galactic open clusters and in field stars with well-defined evolutionary status, as well as in planetary nebulae. Results: Thermohaline mixing simultaneously accounts for the observed behaviour of 12C/13C, [N/C], and lithium in low-mass stars that are more luminous than the RGB bump, and its efficiency is increasing with decreasing initial stellar mass. On the TP-AGB, thermohaline mixing leads to lithium production, although the 7Li yields remain negative. Although the 3He stellar yields are much reduced thanks to this process, we find that solar-metallicity, low-mass stars remain net 3He producers. Rotation-induced mixing is found to change the stellar structure so that in the mass range between {\textasciitilde}1.5 and 2.2 M⊙ the thermohaline instability occurs earlier on the red giant branch than in non-rotating models. Finally rotation accounts for the observed star-to-star abundance variations at a given evolutionary status, and is necessary to explain the features of CN-processed material in intermediate-mass stars. Conclusions: Overall, the present models account for the observational constraints very well over the whole mass range presently investigated.},

abstract = {We argue that the energy injection of pulsations may be of greater importance to the mass-loss rate of AGB stars than metallicity, and that the mass-loss trend with metallicity is not as simple as sometimes assumed. Using our detailed radiation hydrodynamical models that include dust formation, we illustrate the effects of pulsation energy on wind properties. We find that the mass-loss rate scales with the kinetic energy input by pulsations as long as a dust-saturated wind does not occur, and all other stellar parameters are kept constant. This includes the absolute abundance of condensible carbon (not bound in CO), which is more relevant than keeping the C/O-ratio constant when comparing stars of different metallicity. The pressure and temperature gradients in the atmospheres of stars, become steeper and flatter, respectively, when the metallicity is reduced, while the radius where the atmosphere becomes opaque is typically associated with a higher gas pressure. This effect can be compensated for by adjusting the velocity amplitude of the variable inner boundary (piston), which is used to simulate the effects of pulsation, to obtain models with comparable kinetic-energy input. Hence, it is more relevant to compare models with similar energy-injections than of similar velocity amplitude. Since there is no evidence for weaker pulsations in low-metallicity AGB stars, we conclude that it is unlikely that low-metallicity C-stars have lower mass-loss rates, than their more metal-rich counterparts with similar stellar parameters, as long as they have a comparable amount of condensible carbon.},

abstract = {We use recently derived ages for 61 Milky Way (MW) globular clusters (GCs) to show that their age-metallicity relation (AMR) can be divided into two distinct, parallel sequences at [Fe/H] ≳ -1.8. Approximately one-third of the clusters form an offset sequence that spans the full range in age ({\~{ }}10.5-13 Gyr), but is more metal rich at a given age by {\~{ }}0.6 dex in [Fe/H]. All but one of the clusters in the offset sequence show orbital properties that are consistent with membership in the MW disc. They are not simply the most metal-rich GCs, which have long been known to have disc-like kinematics, but they are the most metal-rich clusters at all ages. The slope of the mass-metallicity relation (MMR) for galaxies implies that the offset in metallicity of the two branches of the AMR corresponds to a mass decrement of 2 dex, suggesting host galaxy masses of M_{*} {\~{ }} 107-108 { M_{⊙}} for GCs that belong to the more metal poor AMR. We suggest that the metal-rich branch of the AMR consists of clusters that formed in situ in the disc, while the metal-poor GCs were formed in relatively low-mass (dwarf) galaxies and later accreted by the MW. The observed AMR of MW disc stars, and of the Large Magellanic Cloud, Small Magellanic Cloud and WLM dwarf galaxies, is shown to be consistent with this interpretation, and the relative distribution of implied progenitor masses for the halo GC clusters is in excellent agreement with the MW subhalo mass function predicted by simulations. A notable implication of the bifurcated AMR is that the identical mean ages and spread in ages, for the metal-rich and metal-poor GCs, are difficult to reconcile with an in situ formation for the latter population.},

abstract = {We show that the low ratios of $\alpha$ elements (Mg, Si, and Ca) to Fe recently found for a small fraction of extremely metal-poor stars can be naturally explained with the nucleosynthesis yields of core-collapse supernovae, i.e., 13-25 M ⊙ supernovae, or hypernovae. For the case without carbon enhancement, the ejected iron mass is normal, consistent with observed light curves and spectra of nearby supernovae. On the other hand, the carbon enhancement requires much smaller iron production, and the low [$\alpha$/Fe] of carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars can also be reproduced with 13-25 M ⊙ faint supernovae or faint hypernovae. Iron-peak element abundances, in particular Zn abundances, are important to put further constraints on the enrichment sources from galactic archaeology surveys.},

abstract = {In this paper we analyze the kinematics, chemistry, and physical properties of a sample of the most metal-poor damped Ly$\alpha$ systems (DLAs), to uncover their links to modern-day galaxies. We present evidence that the DLA population as a whole exhibits a "knee" in the relative abundances of the $\alpha$-capture and Fe-peak elements when the metallicity is [Fe/H] sime -2.0, assuming that Zn traces the buildup of Fe-peak elements. In this respect, the chemical evolution of DLAs is clearly different from that experienced by Milky Way halo stars, but resembles that of dwarf spheroidal galaxies in the Local Group. We also find a close correspondence between the kinematics of Local Group dwarf galaxies and of high-redshift metal-poor DLAs, which further strengthens this connection. On the basis of such similarities, we propose that the most metal-poor DLAs provide us with a unique opportunity to directly study the dwarf galaxy population more than ten billion years in the past, at a time when many dwarf galaxies were forming the bulk of their stars. To this end, we have measured some of the key physical properties of the DLA gas, including their neutral gas mass, size, kinetic temperature, density, and turbulence. We find that metal-poor DLAs contain a warm neutral medium with T gas {\textasciitilde}= 9600 K predominantly held up by thermal pressure. Furthermore, all of the DLAs in our sample exhibit a subsonic turbulent Mach number, implying that the gas distribution is largely smooth. These results are among the first empirical descriptions of the environments where the first few generations of stars may have formed in the universe.

abstract = {We use measurements of nitrogen abundances in red giants to search for multiple stellar populations in the four most metal-poor globular clusters (GCs) in the Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy (Fornax 1, 2, 3, and 5). New imaging in the F343N filter, obtained with the Wide Field Camera 3 on the Hubble Space Telescope, is combined with archival F555W and F814W observations to determine the strength of the NH band near 3370 {\AA}. After accounting for observational errors, the spread in the F343N-F555W colors of red giants in the Fornax GCs is similar to that in M15 and corresponds to an abundance range of $\Delta$[N/Fe] {\textasciitilde} 2 dex, as observed also in several Galactic GCs. The spread in F555W-F814W is, instead, fully accounted for by observational errors. The stars with the reddest F343N-F555W colors (indicative of N-enhanced composition) have more centrally concentrated radial distributions in all four clusters, although the difference is not highly statistically significant within any individual cluster. From double-Gaussian fits to the color distributions, we find roughly equal numbers of "N-normal" and "N-enhanced" stars (formally {\textasciitilde}40% N-normal stars in Fornax 1, 3, and 5 and {\textasciitilde}60% in Fornax 2). We conclude that GC formation, in particular, regarding the processes responsible for the origin of multiple stellar populations, appears to have operated similarly in the Milky Way and in the Fornax dSph. Combined with the high ratio of metal-poor GCs to field stars in the Fornax dSph, this places an important constraint on scenarios for the origin of multiple stellar populations in GCs.

abstract = {We substantially update the capabilities of the open source software package Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA), and its one-dimensional stellar evolution module, MESA star. Improvements in MESA star's ability to model the evolution of giant planets now extends its applicability down to masses as low as one-tenth that of Jupiter. The dramatic improvement in asteroseismology enabled by the space-based Kepler and CoRoT missions motivates our full coupling of the ADIPLS adiabatic pulsation code with MESA star. This also motivates a numerical recasting of the Ledoux criterion that is more easily implemented when many nuclei are present at non-negligible abundances. This impacts the way in which MESA star calculates semi-convective and thermohaline mixing. We exhibit the evolution of 3-8 M ⊙ stars through the end of core He burning, the onset of He thermal pulses, and arrival on the white dwarf cooling sequence. We implement diffusion of angular momentum and chemical abundances that enable calculations of rotating-star models, which we compare thoroughly with earlier work. We introduce a new treatment of radiation-dominated envelopes that allows the uninterrupted evolution of massive stars to core collapse. This enables the generation of new sets of supernovae, long gamma-ray burst, and pair-instability progenitor models. We substantially modify the way in which MESA star solves the fully coupled stellar structure and composition equations, and we show how this has improved the scaling of MESA's calculational speed on multi-core processors. Updates to the modules for equation of state, opacity, nuclear reaction rates, and atmospheric boundary conditions are also provided. We describe the MESA Software Development Kit that packages all the required components needed to form a unified, maintained, and well-validated build environment for MESA. We also highlight a few tools developed by the community for rapid visualization of MESA star results.},

abstract = {The entire evolution of the Milky Way, including its mass-assembly and star-formation history, is imprinted onto the chemo-dynamical distribution function of its member stars, f(x, v, [X/H]), in the multi-dimensional phase space spanned by position, velocity, and elemental abundance ratios. In particular, the chemo-dynamical distribution functions for low-mass stars (e.g., G- or K-type dwarfs) are precious tracers of the earliest stages of the Milky Way's formation, since their main-sequence lifetimes approach or exceed the age of the universe. A basic tenet of essentially all previous analyses is that the stellar metallicity, usually parameterized as [Fe/H], is conserved over time for main-sequence stars (at least those that have not been polluted due to mass transfer from binary companions). If this holds true, any correlations between metallicity and kinematics for long-lived main-sequence stars of different masses, effective temperatures, or spectral types must strictly be the same, since they reflect the same mass-assembly and star-formation histories. By analyzing a sample of nearby metal-poor halo and thick-disk stars on the main sequence, taken from Data Release 8 of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we find that the median metallicity of G-type dwarfs is systematically higher (by about 0.2 dex) than that of K-type dwarfs having the same median rotational velocity about the Galactic center. If it can be confirmed, this finding may invalidate the long-accepted assumption that the atmospheric metallicities of long-lived stars are conserved over time.},

Our color-magnitude diagram (CMD) shows the presence of multiple populations along this branch; in particular, we discovered an anomalous branch (RGB-a), which appears to be well separated from the bulk of the RGB stars. On the basis of our CMD and from the previous literature, we conclude that (1) these stars, clearly identified as a separate population in our CMD, represent the extreme metal-rich extension ([Ca/H]>-0.3) of the stellar content of $\omega$ Cen and show anomalous abundances of s-process elements (as Ba and Zr) as well; (2) they are physical members of the $\omega$ Cen system; (3) they comprise {\textasciitilde}5% of the stars of the whole system; and (4) this component and the metal intermediate one (-0.4>[Ca/H]>-1) have been found to share the same spatial distribution, both of them differing significantly from the most metal-poor one ([Ca/H]<-1). This last piece evidence supports the hypothesis that metal-rich components could belong to an independent (proto?) stellar system captured in the past by $\omega$ Cen.

abstract = {The r-process, or the rapid neutron-capture process, of stellar nucleosynthesis is called for to explain the production of the stable (and some long-lived radioactive) neutron-rich nuclides heavier than iron that are observed in stars of various metallicities, as well as in the solar system. A very large amount of nuclear information is necessary in order to model the r-process. This concerns the static characteristics of a large variety of light to heavy nuclei between the valley of stability and the vicinity of the neutron-drip line, as well as their beta-decay branches or their reactivity. Fission probabilities of very neutron-rich actinides have also to be known in order to determine the most massive nuclei that have a chance to be involved in the r-process. Even the properties of asymmetric nuclear matter may enter the problem. The enormously challenging experimental and theoretical task imposed by all these requirements is reviewed, and the state-of-the-art development in the field is presented. Nuclear-physics-based and astrophysics-free r-process models of different levels of sophistication have been constructed over the years. We review their merits and their shortcomings. The ultimate goal of r-process studies is clearly to identify realistic sites for the development of the r-process. Here too, the challenge is enormous, and the solution still eludes us. For long, the core collapse supernova of massive stars has been envisioned as the privileged r-process location. We present a brief summary of the one- or multidimensional spherical or non-spherical explosion simulations available to-date. Their predictions are confronted with the requirements imposed to obtain an r-process. The possibility of r-nuclide synthesis during the decompression of the matter of neutron stars following their merging is also discussed. Given the uncertainties remaining on the astrophysical r-process site and on the involved nuclear physics, any confrontation between predicted r-process yields and observed abundances is clearly risky. A comparison dealing with observed r-nuclide abundances in very metal-poor stars and in the solar system is attempted on grounds of r-process models based on parametrised astrophysics conditions. The virtues of the r-process product actinides for dating old stars or the solar system are also critically reviewed.},

abstract = {The star formation history of the globular cluster $\omega$ Centauri is investigated in the context of an inhomogeneous chemical evolution model in which supernovae induce star formation. The proposed model explains recent observations for $\omega$ Cen stars and divides star formation into three epochs. At the end of the first epoch, {\textasciitilde}70% of the gas was expelled by supernovae. Asymptotic giant branch stars then supplied s-process elements to the remaining gas during the first interval of {\textasciitilde}300 Myr. This explains the observed sudden increase in Ba/Fe ratios in $\omega$ Cen stars at [Fe/H]{\textasciitilde}-1.6. Supernovae at the end of the second epoch were unable to expel the gas. Eventually, Type Ia supernovae initiated supernova-induced star formation, and the remaining gas was stripped when the cluster passed through the newly formed disk of the Milky Way. The formation of $\omega$ Cen is also discussed in the framework of globular cluster formation triggered by cloud-cloud collisions. In this scenario, the relative velocity of clouds in the collision determines the later chemical evolution in the clusters. A head-on collision of protocluster clouds with a low relative velocity would have converted less than 1% of the gas into stars and promoted the subsequent chemical evolution by supernova-driven star formation. This is consistent with present observed form of $\omega$ Cen. In contrast, the other Galactic globular clusters are expected to have formed from more intense head-on collisions, and the resultant clouds would have been too thin for supernovae to accumulate enough gas to form the next generation of stars. This explains the absence of chemical evolution in these other globular clusters.},

abstract = {Using deep high-resolution multiband images taken with the Very Large Telescope and the Hubble Space Telescope, we discovered a new anomalous sequence in the color-magnitude diagram of $\omega$ Cen. This feature appears as a narrow well-defined subgiant branch (SGB-a), which merges into the main sequence of the dominant cluster population at a magnitude significantly fainter than the cluster turnoff (TO). The simplest hypothesis assumes that the new feature is the extension of the anomalous red giant branch (RGB-a) metal-rich population discovered by Lee et al. and Pancino et al. However, under this assumption the interpretation of the SGB-a does not easily fit into the context of a self-enrichment scenario within $\omega$ Cen. In fact, its TO magnitude, shape, and extension are not compatible with a young metal-rich population, as required by the self-enrichment process. The TO level of the SGB-a suggests indeed an age as old as the main cluster population, further supporting the extracluster origin of the most metal-rich stars, as suggested by Ferraro, Bellazzini, {\&} Pancino. Only accurate measurements of radial velocities and metal abundances for a representative sample of stars will firmly establish whether or not the SGB-a is actually related to the RGB-a and will finally shed light on the origin of the metal-rich population of $\omega$ Cen.

abstract = {We study the slow neutron capture process (s-process) in asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars using three different stellar evolutionary models computed for a 3 Msolar, solar metallicity star. First we investigate the formation and the efficiency of the main neutron source: the 13C($\alpha$, n)16O reaction that occurs in radiative conditions. A tiny region rich in 13C (the 13C pocket) is created by proton captures on the abundant 12C in the top layers of the He intershell, the zone between the H shell and the He shell. We parametrically vary the number of protons mixed from the envelope. For high local proton-to-12C number ratios, p/12C>{\textasciitilde}0.3, most of the 13C nuclei produced are further converted by proton capture to 14N. Besides, 14N nuclei represent a major neutron poison. We find that a linear relationship exists between the amount of 12C in the He intershell and the maximum value of the time-integrated neutron flux. Then we generate detailed s-process calculations on the basis of stellar evolutionary models constructed with three different codes, all of them self-consistently finding the third dredge-up, although with different efficiency. One of the codes includes a mechanism at each convective boundary that simulates time-dependent hydrodynamic overshoot. This mechanism depends on a free parameter f and results in partial mixing beyond convective boundaries, the most efficient third dredge-up, and the formation of the 13C pocket. For the other two codes, an identical 13C pocket is introduced in the postprocessing nucleosynthesis calculations. The models typically produce enhancements of heavy elements of about 2 orders of magnitude in the He intershell and of up to 1 order of magnitude at the stellar surface, after dilution with the convective envelope, thus generally reproducing spectroscopic observations. The results of the cases without overshoot are remarkably similar, pointing out that the important uncertainty in s-process predictions is the 13C pocket and not the intrinsic differences among different codes when no overshoot mechanism is included. The code including hydrodynamic overshoot at each convective boundary finds that the He intershell convective zone driven by the recurrent thermal instabilities of the He shell (thermal pulses) penetrates the C-O core, producing a He intershell composition near that observed in H-deficient central stars of planetary nebulae. As a result of this intershell dredge-up, the neutron fluxes have a higher efficiency, both during the interpulse periods and within thermal pulses. The s-element distribution is pushed toward the heavier s-process elements, and large abundances of neutron-rich isotopes fed by branching points in the s-process path are produced. Several observational constraints are better matched by the models without overshoot. Our study needs to be extended to different masses and metallicities and in the space of the free overshoot parameter f.},

abstract = {The Mira variable R Hydrae is well known for its declining period, which Wood {\&} Zarro attributed to a possible recent thermal pulse. Here we investigate the long-term period evolution, covering 340 years, going back to its discovery in AD 1662. The data include photometric monitoring by amateur and other astronomers over the last century, and recorded dates of maximum for earlier times. Wavelets are used to determine both the period and the semi-amplitude. We show that the period decreased linearly between 1770 and 1950; since 1950 the period has stabilized at 385d. The semi-amplitude is shown to follow the period evolution closely. Analysis of the oldest data shows that before 1770 the period was about 495d. We find no evidence for an increasing period during this time as found by Wood {\&} Zarro. We discuss the mass-loss history of R Hya: the IRAS data show that the mass loss dropped dramatically around AD 1750. The evolution of the mass loss as function of period agrees with the mass-loss formalism from Vassiliadis {\&} Wood; it is much larger than predicted by the Bl{\"o}cker law. An outer detached IRAS shell suggests that R Hya has experienced mass-loss interruptions before. The period evolution can be explained by two models: a thermal pulse occurring around AD 1600, or a non-linear instability leading to an internal relaxation of the stellar structure. The elapsed time between the mass-loss decline giving rise to the outer detached shell and the recent event, of approximately 5000yr, suggests that only one of these events could be due to a thermal pulse. Further monitoring of R Hya is recommended, as both models make strong predictions for the future period evolution. We argue that R Hya-type events could provide part of the explanation for the rings seen around some asymptotic giant branch (AGB) and post-AGB stars. Changes in Mira properties were already known on a cycle-to-cycle basis, and on the thermal pulse time-scale of {\textasciitilde}104yr. R Hya shows that significant evolution can also occur on intermediate time-scales of the order of 102-103yr.},

We find that the Sun shows a characteristic signature with a $\approx$20% depletion of refractory elements relative to the volatile elements in comparison with the solar twins. The abundance differences correlate strongly with the condensation temperatures of the elements. This peculiarity also holds in comparisons with solar analogs known to have close-in giant planets while the majority of solar analogs found not to have such giant planets in radial velocity monitoring show the solar abundance pattern. We discuss various explanations for this peculiarity, including the possibility that the differences in abundance patterns are related to the formation of planetary systems like our own, in particular to the existence of terrestrial planets.},

We deduce a dust creation rate of 8 +/- 1 {\texttimes} 10-7 Msolar yr-1, corresponding to approximately 2 per cent by mass of the carbon produced by the Wolf-Rayet star. Simultaneous modelling of the imaging and spectral data enables us to constrain both the opening angle of the wind-wind collision interface and the dust grain size. We conclude that the dust grains in the inner part of the Pinwheel Nebula are small ({\textasciitilde}100 {\AA}), in agreement with theoretical predictions, although we cannot rule out the presence of larger grains ({\textasciitilde}1 $\mu$m) further from the central binary. The opening angle of the wind-wind collision interface appears to be about 40{\textdegree}, in broad agreement with the wind parameters estimated for the central binary. We discuss the success and deficiencies of the model, and the likely benefits of applying similar techniques to the more complex nebulae observed around other WR/O star binaries.},

abstract = {We present analysis of high-resolution spectra of a sample of stars in the globular cluster M5 (NGC 5904). The sample includes stars from the red giant branch (RGB; seven stars), the red horizontal branch (two stars), and the asymptotic giant branch (AGB; eight stars), with effective temperatures ranging from 4000 K to 6100 K. Spectra were obtained with the HIRES spectrometer on the Keck I telescope, with a wavelength coverage from 3700 {\AA} to 7950 {\AA} for the HB and AGB sample, and 5300 {\AA} to 7600 {\AA} for the majority of the RGB sample. We find offsets of some abundance ratios between the AGB and the RGB branches. However, these discrepancies appear to be due to analysis effects, and indicate that caution must be exerted when directly comparing abundance ratios between different evolutionary branches. We find the expected signatures of pollution from material enriched in the products of the hot hydrogen burning cycles such as the CNO, Ne-Na, and Mg-Al cycles, but no significant differences within these signatures among the three stellar evolutionary branches especially when considering the analysis offsets. We are also able to measure an assortment of neutron-capture element abundances, from Sr to Th, in the cluster. We find that the neutron-capture signature for all stars is the same, and shows a predominately r-process origin. However, we also see evidence of a small but consistent extra s-process signature that is not tied to the light-element variations, pointing to a pre-enrichment of this material in the protocluster gas. The data presented herein were obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The Observatory was made possible by the generous financial support of the W. M. Keck Foundation.},

abstract = {The origin of "cosmic" fluorine is uncertain, but there are three proposed production sites/mechanisms for the origin: asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, $\nu$ nucleosynthesis in Type II supernovae, and/or the winds of Wolf-Rayet stars. The relative importance of these production sites has not been established even for the solar neighborhood, leading to uncertainties in stellar evolution models of these stars as well as uncertainties in the chemical evolution models of stellar populations. We determine the fluorine and oxygen abundances in seven bright, nearby giants with well determined stellar parameters. We use the 2.3 $\mu$m vibrational-rotational HF line and explore a pure rotational HF line at 12.2 $\mu$m. The latter has never been used before for an abundance analysis. To be able to do this, we have calculated a line list for pure rotational HF lines. We find that the abundances derived from the two diagnostics agree. Our derived abundances are well reproduced by chemical evolution models including only fluorine production in AGB stars and, therefore, we draw the conclusion that this might be the main production site of fluorine in the solar neighborhood. Furthermore, we highlight the advantages of using the 12 $\mu$m HF lines to determine the possible contribution of the $\nu$ process to the fluorine budget at low metallicities where the difference between models including and excluding this process is dramatic.},

abstract = {Mass-loss of red giant branch (RGB) stars is still poorly determined, despite its crucial role in the chemical enrichment of galaxies. Thanks to the recent detection of solar-like oscillations in G-K giants in open clusters with Kepler, we can now directly determine stellar masses for a statistically significant sample of stars in the old open clusters NGC 6791 and 6819. The aim of this work is to constrain the integrated RGB mass-loss by comparing the average mass of stars in the red clump (RC) with that of stars in the low-luminosity portion of the RGB [i.e. stars with L≲L(RC)]. Stellar masses were determined by combining the available seismic parameters $\nu$max and $\Delta$$\nu$ with additional photometric constraints and with independent distance estimates. We measured the masses of 40 stars on the RGB and 19 in the RC of the old metal-rich cluster NGC 6791. We find that the difference between the average mass of RGB and RC stars is small, but significant [? (random) {\textpm}0.04 (systematic) M⊙]. Interestingly, such a small ? does not support scenarios of an extreme mass-loss for this metal-rich cluster. If we describe the mass-loss rate with Reimers prescription, a first comparison with isochrones suggests that the observed ? is compatible with a mass-loss efficiency parameter in the range 0.1 ≲$\eta$≲ 0.3. Less stringent constraints on the RGB mass-loss rate are set by the analysis of the {\~{ }}2 Gyr old NGC 6819, largely due to the lower mass-loss expected for this cluster, and to the lack of an independent and accurate distance determination. In the near future, additional constraints from frequencies of individual pulsation modes and spectroscopic effective temperatures will allow further stringent tests of the $\Delta$$\nu$ and $\nu$max scaling relations, which provide a novel, and potentially very accurate, means of determining stellar radii and masses.},

abstract = {We present the first detailed and homogeneous analysis of the s-element content in Galactic carbon stars of N type. Abundances of Sr, Y, Zr (low-mass s-elements, or ls), Ba, La, Nd, Sm, and Ce (high-mass s-elements, or hs) are derived using the spectral synthesis technique from high-resolution spectra. The N stars analyzed are of nearly solar metallicity and show moderate s-element enhancements, similar to those found in S stars, but smaller than those found in the only previous similar study (Utsumi 1985), and also smaller than those found in supergiant post-asymptotic giant branch (post-AGB) stars. This is in agreement with the present understanding of the envelope s-element enrichment in giant stars, which is increasing along the spectral sequence M-->MS-->S-->SC-->C during the AGB phase. We compare the observational data with recent s-process nucleosynthesis models for different metallicities and stellar masses. Good agreement is obtained between low-mass AGB star models (M<{\textasciitilde}3 Msolar) and s-element observations. In low-mass AGB stars, the 13C($\alpha$, n)16O reaction is the main source of neutrons for the s-process a moderate spread, however, must exist in the abundance of 13C that is burnt in different stars. By combining information deriving from the detection of Tc, the infrared colors, and the theoretical relations between stellar mass, metallicity, and the final C/O ratio, we conclude that most (or maybe all) of the N stars studied in this work are intrinsic, thermally pulsing AGB stars; their abundances are the consequence of the operation of third dredge-up and are not to be ascribed to mass transfer in binary systems.},

abstract = {We present aluminium abundances for a sample of about 100 red giant stars in each of the Galactic globular clusters 47 Tuc (NGC 104) and M 4 (NGC 6121). We have derived homogeneous abundances from intermediate-resolution FLAMES/GIRAFFE spectra. Aluminium abundances are from the strong doublet Al i 8772-8773 {\AA}, as in previous works done for giants in NGC 6752 and NGC 1851, and nitrogen abundances are extracted from a large number of features of the CN molecules by assuming a suitable carbon abundance. We added previous homogeneous abundances of O and Na and newly derived abundances of Mg and Si for our samples of 83 stars in M 4 and 116 stars in 47 Tuc to obtain the full set of elements from proton-capture reactions produced by different stellar generations in these clusters. By simultaneously studying the Ne-Na and Mg-Al cycles of H-burning at high temperature, our main aims are to understand the nature of the polluters at work in the first generation and to ascertain whether the second generation of cluster stars was formed in one or, rather, several episodes of star formation. Our data confirm that in M 4 only two stellar populations are visible. On the other hand, for 47 Tuc a cluster analysis performed on our full dataset suggests that at least three distinct groups of stars are present on the giant branch. The abundances of O, Na, Mg, and Al in the intermediate group can be produced within a pollution scenario; results for N are ambiguous, depending on the C abundance we adopt for the three groups.

abstract = {We present abundances for 22 chemical elements in 10 red giant members of the massive Galactic globular cluster $\omega$ Centauri. The spectra are of relatively high spectral resolution and signal-to-noise. Using these abundances plus published literature values, abundance trends are defined as a function of the standard metallicity indicator iron. The lowest metallicity stars in $\omega$ Cen have [Fe/H]{\textasciitilde}-1.8, and the initial abundance distribution in the cluster is established at this metallicity. The stars in the cluster span a range of [Fe/H]{\textasciitilde}-1.8 to -0.8. At the lowest metallicity, the heavy-element abundance is found to be well characterized by a scaled solar system r-process distribution, as found in other stellar populations at this metallicity. As iron increases, the s-process heavy-element abundances increase dramatically. Comparisons of the s-process increases with recent stellar models finds that s-process nucleosynthesis in 1.5-3 Msolar asymptotic giant branch stars (AGB) fits well the heavy-element abundance distributions. In these low-mass AGB stars, the dominant neutron source is 13C($\alpha$,n)16O. A comparison of the Rb/Zr abundance ratios in $\omega$ Cen finds that these ratios are consistent with the 13C source. The reason $\omega$ Cen displays such a large s-process component is possibly due to the fact that in such a relatively low-mass stellar system, AGB ejecta, because of their low velocity winds, are more efficiently retained in the cluster relative to the much faster moving Type II supernova ejecta. Significant s-process enrichment relative to Fe, from the lower mass AGB stars, would require that the cluster was active in star formation for quite a long interval of time, of the order of 2-3 Gyr. The AGB ejecta were mixed with the retained fraction of Type II supernova ejecta and with the residual gas of initial composition. The analysis of $\alpha$-rich elements shows that no significant amounts of Type Ia supernova debris were retained by the cluster. In this context, interpretation of the low and constant observed [Cu/Fe]{\textasciitilde}-0.6 (derived here for the first time in this cluster) finds a plausible interpretation.},

abstract = {Context. In spite of many observational efforts to characterize the chemical evolution of our Galaxy, not much is known about the origin of fluorine (F). Models suggest that the F found in the Galaxy might have been produced mainly in three different ways, namely, Type II supernovae, asymptotic giant branch nucleosynthesis, or in the core of Wolf-Rayet stars. Only a few observational measurements of F abundances are available in the literature and mostly for objects whose characteristics might hamper an accurate determination of fluorine abundance (e.g., complex mixing and nucleosynthesis processes, external/internal contamination). Aims: We acquire data using the high-resolution IR-spectrograph CRIRES and gather FEROS data from the European Southern Observatory archive. The classical method of spectral synthesis in local thermodynamic equilibrium has been used to perform the abundance analysis. Methods: We derive the F abundances of nine cool main-sequence dwarfs in the solar neighbourhood, based on an unblended line of the HF molecule at 2.3 microns. In addition, we study the s-process elements of five of these stars. Results: Several of the analysed stars seem to be slightly fluorine enhanced with respect to the Sun, although no correlation is found between the F abundance and the iron content. In addition, the most fluorine enriched stars are also yttrium and zirconium enriched, which suggests that AGB fluorine nucleosynthesis is the dominant source of fluorine production for the observed stars. Nevertheless, the correlation between [F/Fe] and the s-elements is rather weak and possibly masked by the uncertainties in the F abundance measurements. Finally, we compare our derived F abundances to previous measurements of alpha-element and iron-peak element abundances. Type II core collapse supernovae do not appear to be the main site of F production for our targets, as no correlation seems to exist between the [F/Fe] and the [$\alpha$/Fe] ratios.

abstract = {Aims: We propose an explanation for the considerable scatter of the abundances of neutron capture elements observed in low-metallicity stars in the solar vicinity, compared to the small star-to-star scatter observed for the $\alpha$-elements. Methods: We have developed a stochastic chemical evolution model in which the main assumption is a random formation of new stars subject to the condition that the cumulative mass distribution follows a given initial mass function. Results: With our model, we are able to reproduce the different spreads of neutron capture elements and $\alpha$-elements in low-metallicity stars. Conclusions: The reason for different observed spreads in neutron capture elements and $\alpha$-elements resides in the random birth of stars, coupled with different stellar mass ranges, from which $\alpha$-elements and neutron capture elements originate. In particular, the site of production of $\alpha$-elements is the whole range of massive stars, from 10 to 80 M{\&}sun; whereas the mass range of production for neutron capture elements lies between 12 and 30 M{\&}sun;.},

abstract = {Context. Recent studies have confirmed the long standing suspicion that M 22 shares a metallicity spread and complex chemical enrichment history similar to that observed in $\omega$ Cen. M 22 is among the most massive Galactic globular clusters and its color-magnitude diagram and chemical abundances reveal the existence of sub-populations. Aims: To further constrain the chemical diversity of M 22, necessary to interpret its nucleosynthetic history, we seek to measure relative abundance ratios of key elements (carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and fluorine) best studied, or only available, using high-resolution spectra at infrared wavelengths. Methods: High-resolution (R = 50 000) and high S/N infrared spectra were acquired of nine red giant stars with Phoenix at the Gemini-South telescope. Chemical abundances were calculated through a standard 1D local thermodynamic equilibrium analysis using Kurucz model atmospheres. Results: We derive [Fe/H] = -1.87 to -1.44, confirming at infrared wavelengths that M 22 does present a [Fe/H] spread. We also find large C and N abundance spreads, which confirm previous results in the literature but based on a smaller sample. Our results show a spread in A(C+N+O) of {\textasciitilde} 0.7 dex. Similar to mono-metallic globular clusters, M 22 presents a strong [Na/Fe]-[O/Fe] anticorrelation as derived from Na and CO lines in the K band. For the first time we recover F abundances in M 22 and find that it exhibits a 0.6 dex variation. We find tentative evidence for a flatter A(F)-A(O) relation compared to higher metallicity globular clusters. Conclusions: Our study confirms and expands upon the chemical diversity seen in this complex stellar system. All elements studied to date show large abundance spreads which require contributions from both massive and low mass stars.},

Methods: .We have calculated chemically homogeneous models of Wolf-Rayet stars of 10 to 200 M⊙ for two metallicities (Z=0.02 and Z=0.001), without mass loss, using OPAL opacities. We also constructed theoretical helium main sequences for 15, 18, 24 and 30 M⊙ with stellar wind mass loss rates of 10-5 M⊙ yr-1 and 10-4 M⊙ yr-1 and models for a 24 M⊙ star for a few intermediate values of mass loss rate. Results: .We confirm the radius extension for luminous, metal-rich Wolf-Rayet stars reported previously by Ishii et al. (1999, PASJ, 51, 417), i.e. the inflation of the hydrostatic stellar radius. We also show that for small values of the stellar wind mass loss rate, an extended envelope structure is still present. However, for mass loss rates above a critical value, for which we derive an expression, Wolf-Rayet radii decrease and the stellar structure becomes compact. We briefly discuss possible evolutionary and observational consequences of an inflated envelope for a mass losing Wolf-Rayet star.},

abstract = {We study the initiation of the detonation in the gravitationally confined detonation (GCD) model of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). In this model, ignition occurs at one or several off-center points, resulting in a burning bubble of hot ash that rises rapidly, breaks through the surface of the star, and collides at a point on the stellar surface opposite the breakout, producing a high-velocity inwardly directed flow. Initiation of the detonation occurs spontaneously in a region where the length scale of the temperature gradient extending from the flow (in which carbon burning is already occurring) into unburned fuel is commensurate to the range of critical length scales which have been derived from one-dimensional simulations that resolve the initiation of a detonation. By increasing the maximum resolution in a truncated cone that encompasses this region, beginning somewhat before initiation of the detonation occurs, we successfully simulate in situ the first gradient-initiated detonation in a whole-star simulation. The detonation emerges when a compression wave overruns a pocket of fuel situated in a Kelvin-Helmholtz cusp at the leading edge of the inwardly directed jet of burning carbon. The compression wave preconditions the temperature in the fuel in such a way that the Zel'dovich gradient mechanism can operate and a detonation ensues. We explore the dependence of the length scale of the temperature gradient on spatial resolution and discuss the implications for the robustness of this detonation mechanism. We find that the time and the location at which initiation of the detonation occurs varies with resolution. In particular, initiation of a detonation had not yet occurred in our highest resolution simulation by the time we ended the simulation because of the computational demand it required. However, it may detonate later. We suggest that the turbulent shear layer surrounding the inwardly directed jet provides the most favorable physical conditions, and therefore the most likely location, for initiation of a detonation in the GCD model.},

abstract = {The authors suggest that some of the central stars of planetary nebulae experience a final thermal pulse after having achieved a white dwarf configuration and begun their descent along a cooling white dwarf sequence of nearly constant radius. Theoretical calculations show that there are two possible paths for the evolution of a PN nucleus past the final thermal pulse. In the first case, the pulse occurs well up on the white dwarf cooling track while the star is surrounded by a visible planetary nebula. The subsequent giant phase is of too short a duration to be observable, and the star next appears on the high-luminosity portion of the quiescent helium-burning track, where it may be identified with the nuclei of planetaries like Abell 30 and Abell 78. In the second case, the pulse occurs farther down on the track, when the surrounding nebulae would no longer be visible on existing surveys. The star remains longer in its giant state, where it is identified with the R CrB stars. Eventually, both of these fade to become non-DA white dwarfs.},

abstract = {We present an extensive set of detailed stellar models in the mass range 7.7-10.5 Msolar over the metallicity range Z = 10-5-0.02. These models were produced using the Monash University version of the Mount Stromlo Stellar Structure Program (MONSTAR) and follow the evolution from the pre-main sequence to the first thermal pulse of these super asymptotic giant branch stars. A quantitative comparison is made to the study of Siess. Prior to this study, only qualitative comparisons and code validations existed in this critical mass range, and the large variations in the literature were largely unexplained. The comparison presented here is particularly detailed due to the standardization of the input physics, where possible. The minimum initial mass of star which ignites carbon, Mup, was found to agree within 0.2Msolar between the codes over the entire metallicity range. We find exceptional agreement in the model results between these two codes for all stages of evolution up to and including carbon burning. For additional comparison, we also present results from the EVOLVE code, a modified version of the IBEN code as described in Gil-Pons, Guti{\'e}rrez {\&} Garc{\'\i}a-Berro for some important variables during the carbon burning phase. Several numerical tests showed that the carbon burning phase is weakly dependent on the spatial resolution but that inadequate temporal resolution alters the behaviour of the convective zones. We also discovered that stars just below Mup may experience a carbon flash that is not followed by the development of the flame. Such aborted carbon burning models thus preserve a CO core surrounding by a 0.2-0.3Msolar shell of partially burnt carbon material. We present a simplified algorithm for calculating carbon burning that only relies on tracking two species, 12C and 16O, but which tests show works quite accurately for the a wide range of initial masses and compositions.},

In this paper we present results from the investigation of r-process in the high-entropy wind (HEW) of core-collapse supernovae (here chosen as one of the possible scenarios for this nucleosynthesis process), using new nuclear-data input calculated in a consistent approach, for masses and $\beta$-decay properties from the new finite-range droplet model FRDM(2012). The accuracy of the new mass model is 0.56 MeV with respect to AME2003, to which it was adjusted. We compare the new HEW r-process abundance pattern to the latest S.S. r-process residuals and to our earlier calculations with the nuclear-structure quantities based on FRDM(1992). Substantial overall and specific local improvements in the calculated pattern of the r-process between A {\textasciitilde}= 110 and 209Bi, as well as remaining deficiencies, are discussed in terms of the underlying spherical and deformed shell structure far from stability.},

abstract = {Aims: We provide new constraints on the chemo-dynamical models of the Milky Way by measuring the radial and vertical chemical gradients for the elements Mg, Al, Si, Ti, and Fe in the Galactic disc and the gradient variations as a function of the distance from the Galactic plane (Z). Methods: We selected a sample of giant stars from the RAVE database using the gravity criterium 1.7 <log g< 2.8. We created a RAVE mock sample with the Galaxia code based on the Besan{\c c}on model and selected a corresponding mock sample to compare the model with the observed data. We measured the radial gradients and the vertical gradients as a function of the distance from the Galactic plane Z to study their variation across the Galactic disc. Results: The RAVE sample exhibits a negative radial gradient of d[Fe/H]/dR = -0.054 dex kpc-1 close to the Galactic plane (| Z | < 0.4 kpc) that becomes flatter for larger | Z |. Other elements follow the same trend although with some variations from element to element. The mock sample has radial gradients in fair agreement with the observed data. The variation of the gradients with Z shows that the Fe radial gradient of the RAVE sample has little change in the range | Z | ≲ 0.6 kpc and then flattens. The iron vertical gradient of the RAVE sample is slightly negative close to the Galactic plane and steepens with | Z |. The mock sample exhibits an iron vertical gradient that is always steeper than the RAVE sample. The mock sample also shows an excess of metal-poor stars in the [Fe/H] distributions with respect to the observed data.

abstract = {We measure the red giant branch bump (RGBB) of the Galactic bulge, the most metal-rich RGBB ever detected. The RGBB luminosity function peaks at the expected brightness, but its number density is very low relative to Galactic globular cluster calibrations, implying the Galactic bulge has a higher helium enrichment parameter $\Delta$Y/$\Delta$Z >= 4.0 for Y {\textasciitilde} 0.35 rather than the standard 2.0 with Y = 0.27, which we suggest may be a common feature of galactic spheroids. The RGBB is (0.71 {\textpm} 0.02) mag fainter than the red clump (RC) in I toward the densest stellar regions imaged by the OGLE-III Galactic bulge photometric survey, (|l| <= 4, 2 <{\textasciitilde} |b| <= 4). The number density of RGBB stars is (12.7 {\textpm} 2.0)% that of RC stars. The brightness dispersion of the RGBB is significantly lower than that of the RC, a result that is difficult to explain as the RGBB luminosity is known to vary significantly with metallicity. Sight lines that have two RCs have two RGBBs with similar properties to one another, an expected outcome if the Milky Way's bulge is X-shaped. We also find preliminary evidence of the Galactic bulge asymptotic giant branch bump, at a brightness of {\textasciitilde}1.06 mag brighter than the RC in I and with a number density {\textasciitilde}1.5% that of the RC. Accounting for the RGBB has a small effect on the best-fit parameters of the RC, shifting its best-fit peak brightness and reducing its brightness dispersion by {\textasciitilde}0.015 mag each.},

abstract = {We have restudied line-strength gradients of 80 elliptical galaxies. Typical metallicity gradients of elliptical galaxies are $\Delta$[Fe/H]/$\Delta$logr{\textasciitilde}=-0.3, which is flatter than the gradients predicted by monolithic collapse simulations. The metallicity gradients do not correlate with any physical properties of galaxies, including central and mean metallicities, central velocity dispersions $\sigma$0, absolute B magnitudes MB, absolute effective radii Re, and dynamical masses of galaxies. By using the metallicity gradients, we have calculated mean stellar metallicities for individual ellipticals. Typical mean stellar metallicities are <[Fe/H]>{\textasciitilde}=-0.3 and range from <[Fe/H]>{\textasciitilde}=-0.8 to +0.3, which is contrary to what Gonzalez {\&} Gorgas claimed; the mean metallicities of ellipticals are not universal. The mean metallicities correlate well with $\sigma$0 and dynamical masses, though relations for MB and Re include significant scatters. We find fundamental planes defined by surface brightnesses SBe, <[Fe/H]>, and Re (or MB), the scatters of which are much smaller than those of the <[Fe/H]>-Re (or <[Fe/H]>-MB) relations. The <[Fe/H]>-log$\sigma$0 relation is nearly parallel to the [Fe/H]0-log$\sigma$0 relation but systematically lower by 0.3 dex; thus the mean metallicities are about one-half of the central values. The metallicity-mass relation or, equivalently, the color-magnitude relation of ellipticals holds not only for the central parts of galaxies but also for entire galaxies. Assuming that Mg2 and Fe1 give [Mg/H] and [Fe/H], respectively, we find <[Mg/Fe]>{\textasciitilde}=+0.2 in most of elliptical galaxies. <[Mg/Fe]> shows no correlation with galaxy mass tracers such as $\sigma$0, in contrast to what was claimed for the central [Mg/Fe]. This can be most naturally explained if the star formation had stopped in elliptical galaxies before the bulk of Type Ia supernovae began to occur. Elliptical galaxies can have significantly different metallicity gradients and <[Fe/H]>, even if they have the same galaxy mass. This may result from galaxy mergers, but no evidence is found from presently available data to support the same origin for metallicity gradients, the scatters around the metallicity-mass relation, and dynamical disturbances. This may suggest that the scatters have their origin at the formation epoch of galaxies.},

Jansky Very Large Array compiled with work in the literature to explore the range of conditions observed in young, massive star-forming regions. To sample the effects of evolution independent from those of distance/resolution, abundance, and large-scale environment, we compare clumps in different evolutionary stages within a single infrared dark cloud (IRDC), G32.02+0.06. We find that the early stages of clustered star formation are characterized by dense, parsec-scale filamentary structures interspersed with complexes of dense cores (<0.1 pc cores clustered in complexes separated by {\textasciitilde}1 pc) with masses from about 10 to 100 M ⊙. The most quiescent core is the most extended while the star forming cores are denser and more compact, showing very similar column density structure before and shortly after the onset of massive star formation, with peak surface densities $\Sigma$ >{\textasciitilde} 1 g cm-2. Quiescent cores and filaments show smoothly varying temperatures from 10 to 20 K, rising to over 40 K in star-forming cores. We calculate virial parameters for 16 cores and find that the level of support provided by turbulence is generally insufficient to support them against gravitational collapse (lang$\alpha$virrang {\textasciitilde} 0.6). The star-forming filaments show smooth velocity fields, punctuated by discontinuities at the sites of active star formation. We discuss the massive molecular filament (M {\textasciitilde} 105 M ⊙, length >60 pc) hosting the IRDC, hypothesizing that it may have been shaped by previous generations of massive stars.},

abstract = {A fraction of the first generation of stars in the early universe may be very massive (≳ 300 {{M}⊙ }) as they form in metal-free environments. Formation of black holes from these stars can be accompanied by supermassive collapsars to produce long gamma-ray bursts of a unique type having a very high total energy ({\~{ }} {{10}54} erg) as recently suggested by several authors. We present new stellar evolution models of very massive Population III stars including the effect of rotation to provide theoretical constraints on super-collapsar progenitors. We find that the angular momentum condition for a super-collapsar can be fulfilled if magnetic torques are ignored, in which case Eddington-Sweet circulations play the dominant role for the transport of angular momentum. We further find that the initial mass range for super-collapsar progenitors would be limited to 300 {{M}⊙ }≲ M≲ 700 {{M}⊙ }. However, all of our very massive star models of this mass range end their lives as red supergiants rather than blue supergiants, in good agreement with most of the previous studies. The predicted final fate of these stars is either a jet-powered type IIP supernova or an ultra-long, relatively faint gamma-ray transient, depending on the initial amount of angular momentum.},

abstract = {Context: The evolution of the Milky Way bulge and its relationship with the other Galactic populations is still poorly understood. The bulge has been suggested to be either a merger-driven classical bulge or the product of a dynamical instability of the inner disk. Aims: To probe the star formation history, the initial mass function and stellar nucleosynthesis of the bulge, we performed an elemental abundance analysis of bulge red giant stars. We also completed an identical study of local thin disk, thick disk and halo giants to establish the chemical differences and similarities between the various populations. Methods: High-resolution infrared spectra of 19 bulge giants and 49 comparison giants in the solar neighborhood were acquired with Gemini/Phoenix. All stars have similar stellar parameters but cover a broad range in metallicity. A standard 1D local thermodynamic equilibrium analysis yielded the abundances of C, N, O and Fe. A homogeneous and differential analysis of the bulge, halo, thin disk and thick disk stars ensured that systematic errors were minimized. Results: We confirm the well-established differences for [O/Fe] (at a given metallicity) between the local thin and thick disks. For the elements investigated, we find no chemical distinction between the bulge and the local thick disk, which is in contrast to previous studies relying on literature values for disk dwarf stars in the solar neighborhood. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the bulge and local thick disk experienced similar, but not necessarily shared, chemical evolution histories. We argue that their formation timescales, star formation rates and initial mass functions were similar.},

The first one deals with one of the most unresolved problems in astrophysics, i.e., the existence of a blue loop after core helium ignition; the so called "to loop or not to loop" problem. We show that inward overshooting from the outer convective zone in the red giant phase is prerequisite for the development of the blue loop. Our second question concerns pulsational instability of models in the core helium burning phase. We present for the first time that models on the blue loop can have unstable modes driven by the $\kappa$ mechanism operating in the $Z-$bump. Contrary to post-main sequence models in the shell hydrogen burning phases, pulsational instability of the blue loop models depends mainly on effective temperature and metallicity is of secondary importance. Finally, we try to interpret the oscillation spectrum of the blue supergiant HD 163899, the only member of the SPBsg class, and to get some clue on the evolutionary status of the star.},

Recently, Herwig et al. (1998) have presented full calculations of TP-AGB models with strong dredge-up occurring already during early thermal pulses. The resulting luminosity evolution differs appreciably from the simple linear Mc-L relation. In this paper, we show that at least part of the luminosity evolution can be understood as being the result of two well-known effects: the gradual approach to the asymptotic behaviour that characterises the first thermal pulses, and the chemical composition changes of the envelope. Both effects are already implemented in the Mc-L relations used in synthetic models. Consequently, these models are able to reproduce the behaviour of full calculations. Whether additional effects, not yet taken into account, are present, can be decided only through additional calculations and data. We also comment on the validity of a linear Mc-L relation and its possible violation, as mentioned by Herwig et al.},

abstract = {The information on the chemical compositions of stars encoded in their spectra plays a central role in contemporary astrophysics. Stellar element abundances are, however, not observed: to decipher the spectral fingerprints in terms of abundances requires realistic models for the stellar atmospheres and the line-formation processes. Still today, the vast majority of abundance analyses of late-type stars rely on one-dimensional (1D), hydrostatic model atmospheres and the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). In this review possible systematic errors in studies of F-, G- and K-type stars introduced by these questionable approximations are discussed. Departures from LTE are commonplace and often quite severe, in particular for low surface gravities or metallicities, with minority species and low-excitation transitions being the most vulnerable. Recently, time-dependent, 3D, hydrodynamical model atmospheres have started to be employed for stellar abundance purposes, with large differences compared with 1D modeling found in particular for metal-poor stars. An assessment of non-LTE and 3D effects for individual elements as well as on the estimated stellar parameters is presented.},

abstract = {We present an evolutionary sequence of a low mass star from the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) through its post-AGB stage, during which its surface chemical composition changes from hydrogen-rich to strongly hydrogen-deficient as consequence of a very late thermal pulse, following the so-called born-again scenario. The internal structure and abundance changes during this pulse are computed with a numerical method which allows the physically consistent calculation of stellar layers where thermonuclear and mixing time scale are comparable -- a situation which occurs when the helium flash driven convection zone extends to the hydrogen-rich surface layers during the pulse peak. The final surface mass fractions are [He/C/O]=[0.38/0.36/0.22], where the high oxygen abundance is due to diffusive overshoot employed during the AGB evolution. These models are the first to achieve general agreement with the surface abundance pattern observed in hydrogen-deficient post-AGB stars -- e.g. the PG 1159 stars or the WR-type central stars of planetary nebulae --, confirming the born-again scenario with a physically consistent calculation and supporting the occurrence of convective overshooting in thermally pulsing AGB stars.},

abstract = {We describe the latest developments of the Geneva stellar evolution code in order to model the pre-supernova evolution of rotating massive stars. Rotating and non-rotating stellar models at solar metallicity with masses equal to 12, 15, 20, 25, 40 and 60 M⊙ were computed from the ZAMS until the end of the core silicon burning phase. We took into account meridional circulation, secular shear instabilities, horizontal turbulence and dynamical shear instabilities. We find that dynamical shear instabilities mainly smoothen the sharp angular velocity gradients but do not transport angular momentum or chemical species over long distances. Most of the differences between the pre-supernova structures obtained from rotating and non-rotating stellar models have their origin in the effects of rotation during the core hydrogen and helium burning phases. The advanced stellar evolutionary stages appear too short in time to allow the rotational instabilities considered in this work to have a significant impact during the late stages. In particular, the internal angular momentum does not change significantly during the advanced stages of the evolution. We can therefore have a good estimate of the final angular momentum at the end of the core helium burning phase. The effects of rotation on pre-supernova models are significant between 15 and 30 M⊙. Indeed, rotation increases the core sizes (and the yields) by a factor {\~{ }}1.5. Above 20 M⊙, rotation may change the radius or colour of the supernova progenitors (blue instead of red supergiant) and the supernova type (IIb or Ib instead of II). Rotation affects the lower mass limits for radiative core carbon burning, for iron core collapse and for black hole formation. For Wolf-Rayet stars (M ⪆ 30 M⊙), the pre-supernova structures are mostly affected by the intensities of the stellar winds and less by rotational mixing.},

abstract = {We use the combination of photometric and spectroscopic data of 47 Tuc stars to reconstruct the possible formation of a second generation of stars in the central regions of the cluster, from matter ejected by massive asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars diluted with pristine gas. The yields from massive AGB stars with the appropriate metallicity (Z = 0.004, i.e. [Fe/H] = -0.75) are compatible with the observations in terms of extension and slope of the patterns observed, involving oxygen, nitrogen, sodium and aluminium. Based on the constraints on the maximum helium of 47 Tuc stars provided by photometric investigations and on the helium content of the ejecta, we estimate that the gas out of which second-generation stars formed was composed of about one-third of gas from intermediate-mass stars, with M $\ge$ 5 M⊙ and about two-thirds of pristine gas. We tentatively identify the few stars whose Na, Al and O abundances resemble the undiluted AGB yields with the small fraction of 47 Tuc stars populating the faint subgiant branch. From the relative fraction of first- and second-generation stars currently observed, we estimate that the initial first-generation population in 47 Tuc was about 7.5 times more massive than the cluster current total mass.},

abstract = {We obtained high-resolution spectra for 94 candidate stars belonging to the HB of M 22 with FLAMES. Previous works have indicated that this cluster has split subgiant (SGB) and red giant branches (RGB) and hosts two different stellar populations, differing in overall metal abundance and both exhibiting a Na-O anti-correlation. The HB stars we observed span a restricted temperature range (7800 < Teff < 11 000 K), where about 60% of the HB stars of M 22 are. Within our sample, we can distinguish three groups of stars segregated (though contiguous) in colours: Group 1 (49 stars) is metal-poor, N-normal, Na-poor, and O-rich: our abundances for this (cooler) group match those determined for the primordial group of RGB stars (a third of the total) from previous studies very well. Group 2 (23 stars) is still metal-poor, but it is N- and Na-rich, though only very mildly depleted in O. We can identify this intermediate group as the progeny of the metal-poor RGB stars that occupy an intermediate location along the Na-O anti-correlation and include about 10% of the RGB stars. The third group (20 stars) is metal-rich, Na-rich, and O-rich. This hotter group most likely corresponds to the most O-rich component of the previously found metal-rich RGB population (a quarter of the total). We did not observe any severely O-depleted stars and we think that the progeny of these stars falls on the hotter part of the HB. Furthermore, we found that the metal-rich population is also over-abundant in Sr, in agreement with results for corresponding RGB and SGB stars. However, we do not find any significant variation in the ratio between the sum of N and O abundances to Fe. We do not have C abundances for our stars. There is some evidence of an enhancement of He content for Groups 2 and 3 stars (Y = 0.338 {\textpm} 0.014 {\textpm} 0.05); the error bar due to systematics is large, but a consistent analysis of data for several GCs confirms that stars in these groups within M 22 are probably overabundant in He. We conclude that on the whole, our results agree with the proposition that chemical composition drives the location of stars along the HB of a GC. Furthermore, we found a number of fast rotators. They are concentrated in a restricted temperature range along the HB of M 22. Fast rotating stars might be slightly less massive and bluer than slowly rotating ones, but other interpretations are possible.

abstract = {Evolution of a Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) progenitor requires formation of a CO white dwarf (WD), which implies a dependence on the C-burning rate (CBR). It can also be affected by the recently identified possibility of C-flame quenching by convective boundary mixing. We present first results of our study of the combined effect of these two potential sources of uncertainty on the SN Ia progenitor evolution. We consider the possibility that the CBR is higher than its currently recommended value by as much as a factor of 1000 if unidentified resonances are important, or that it is significantly lower because of the hindrance effect. For stellar models that assume the Schwarzschild boundary for convection, the maximum initial mass for the formation of CO WDs increases from Mi $\approx$ 5.5 M⊙ for the CBR factor of 1000 to Mi ≳ 7.0 M⊙ for the CBR factor of 0.01. For C-flame quenching models, hybrid C-O-Ne WDs form for a range of initial mass of $\Delta$Mi $\approx$ 1 M⊙, which increases a fraction of stars that form WDs capable of igniting C in a thermonuclear runaway. The most extreme case is found for the CBR factor of 0.1 that is supported by the hindrance model. This nuclear physics assumption, combined with C-flame quenching, leads to the formation of a hybrid C-O-Ne WD with a mass of 1.3 M⊙. Such WDs do not need to accrete much mass to reach the Chandrasekhar limit.},

For stellar models with up-to-date input physics, including molecular opacities and the associated higher mixing length, the breakdown takes place at core masses greater than or approximately equal to 0.85 solar luminosity, i.e., luminosities brighter than Mbol of about -6. This occurs in stars of initial mass greater than or approximately equal to 5 solar luminosities for Population I (Z = 0.02) compositions, and greater than or approximately equal to 4 solar luminosities for Population II (Z = 0.001). For these stars, the luminosity increases much more steeply than the MC-L relation would predict, and is no longer independent of the stellar mass. Large mass loss rates can turn off hot bottom burning by significantly reducing the star's mass (and thus the temperature at the base of the convective envelope), causing the star's luminosity to decline toward the standard MC-L relation; such mass-loss rates are still an order of magnitude less than that observed in some OH/IR stars. Uncertainties in molecular opacities can significantly affect the extent of hot bottom burning, and thus the luminosities attained.},

abstract = {The driving mechanism of the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) superwind has become controversial in recent years. The efficacy of dust-driven mass loss has been queried. Spitzer observation of AGB stars in local group galaxies shows the surprising result that at low metallicity, AGB mass loss occurs at low luminosity, possibly lower than in the Galaxy, but only for carbon-rich stars. Oxygen-rich stars in the Galaxy and in lower metallicity galaxies have similar mass-loss rates only at high luminosities. To explain this dichotomy, we propose that the superwind has a dual trigger. The superwind starts either when sufficient excess carbon builds up for efficient formation of carbonaceous dust [which we propose occurs when XCO = (C - O)/Osolar = 0.1], or when the luminosity reaches a value sufficient for a silicate dust-driven wind (proposed at L = 104Z-4/3Lsolar). We show that this dual trigger fits the current observational constraints: the luminosity at which the superwind begins, and the predominance of carbon superwind star at low metallicity. We use stellar evolution models to check the consistency of our explanations and present detailed predictions of the luminosities at which the superwind is triggered for different metallicities and initial stellar masses.},

abstract = {We present a detailed chemical composition analysis of 35 red giant stars in the globular cluster M 22. High resolution spectra for this study were obtained at five observatories, and analyzed in a uniform manner. We have determined abundances of representative light proton-capture, $\alpha$, Fe-peak and neutron-capture element groups. Our aim is to better understand the peculiar chemical enrichment history of this cluster, in which two stellar groups are characterized by a different content in iron, neutron capture elements Y, Zr and Ba, and $\alpha$ element Ca. The principal results of this study are: (i) substantial star-to-star metallicity scatter (- 2.0 ≲ [Fe/H] ≲ -1.6); (ii) enhancement of s-process/r-process neutron-capture abundance ratios in a fraction of giants, positively correlated with metallicity; (iii) sharp separation between the s-process-rich and s-process-poor groups by [La/Eu] ratio; (iv) possible increase of [Cu/Fe] ratios with increasing [Fe/H], suggesting that this element also has a significant s-process component; and (v)presence of Na-O and C-N anticorrelations in both the stellar groups.

abstract = {We establish new constraints on the intermediate-mass range of the initial-final mass relation, and apply the results to study the evolution of stars on the thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch (TP-AGB). These constraints derive from newly discovered (bright) white dwarfs in the nearby Hyades and Praesepe star clusters, including a total of 18 high signal-to-noise ratio measurements with progenitor masses of M initial = 2.8-3.8 M ⊙. We also include a new analysis of existing white dwarfs in the older NGC 6819 and NGC 7789 star clusters, M initial = 1.6 and 2.0 M ⊙. Over this range of initial masses, stellar evolutionary models for metallicity Z initial = 0.02 predict the maximum growth of the core of TP-AGB stars. By comparing the newly measured remnant masses to the robust prediction of the core mass at the first thermal pulse on the AGB (i.e., from stellar interior models), we establish several findings. First, we show that the stellar core mass on the AGB grows rapidly from 10% to 30% for stars with M initial = 1.6 to 2.0 M ⊙. At larger masses, the core-mass growth decreases steadily to {\textasciitilde}10% at M initial = 3.4 M ⊙, after which there is a small hint of a upturn out to M initial = 3.8 M ⊙. These observations are in excellent agreement with predictions from the latest TP-AGB evolutionary models in Marigo et al. We also compare to models with varying efficiencies of the third dredge-up and mass loss, and demonstrate that the process governing the growth of the core is largely the stellar wind, while the third dredge-up plays a secondary, but non-negligible role. Based on the new white dwarf measurements, we perform an exploratory calibration of the most popular mass-loss prescriptions in the literature, as well as of the third dredge-up efficiency as a function of the stellar mass. Finally, we estimate the lifetime and the integrated luminosity of stars on the TP-AGB to peak at t {\textasciitilde} 3 Myr and E = 1.2 {\texttimes} 1010 L ⊙ yr for M initial {\textasciitilde} 2 M ⊙ (t {\textasciitilde} 2 Myr for luminosities brighter than the red giant branch tip at log (L/L ⊙) > 3.4), decreasing to t = 0.4 Myr and E = 6.1 {\texttimes} 109 L ⊙ yr for stars with M initial {\textasciitilde} 3.5 M ⊙. The implications of these results are discussed, especially with respect to general studies aimed at characterizing the integrated light output of TP-AGB stars in population synthesis models.},

abstract = {The stars in a globular cluster (GC) have always been considered coeval and of the same metallicity. Recently, this assumption has been challenged on the basis of spectroscopic and photometric observations, which show various generations of stars in GCs, differing in the abundances of products of H-burning at high temperatures. The main final product of this burning is He. It is then important to study the connections between stars properties and He content. We consider here the nearly 1400 stars on the red giant branch (RGB) observed with FLAMES@VLT in 19 Galactic Globular Clusters (GCs) in the course of our project on the Na-O anticorrelation. Stars with different He are expected to have different temperatures (i.e., different colours), slightly different metallicities [Fe/H], and different luminosity levels of the RGB bump. All these differences are small, but our study has the necessary precision, good statistics, and homogeneity to detect them. Besides considering the observed colours and the temperatures and metallicities determined in our survey, we computed suitable sets of stellar models - fully consistent with those present in the BaSTI archive - for various assumptions about the initial He content. We find that differences in observable quantities that can be attributed to variations in He content are generally detectable between stars of the primordial (P, first-generation) and extreme (E, second-generation) populations, but not between the primordial and intermediate ones (I). The only exception, where differences are also significant between P and I populations, is the cluster NGC 2808, where three populations are clearly separated also on the main sequence and possibly on the horizontal branch. The average enhancement in the He mass fraction Y between P and E stars is about 0.05-0.11, depending on the assumptions. The differences in Y, for NGC 2808 alone, are about 0.11-0.14 between P and I stars, and about 0.15-0.19 between P and E stars, again depending on the assumptions. When we consider the RGB bump luminosity of first and second-generation stars we find different levels; the implied Y difference is more difficult to quantify, but agrees with the other determinations. Based on observations collected at ESO telescopes under programmes 072.D-507 and 073.D-0211.},

abstract = {Star formation can be triggered by compression from wind or supernova-driven shock waves that sweep over molecular clouds. Because these shocks will likely contain processed elements, triggered star formation has been proposed as an explanation for short-lived radioactive isotopes (SLRIs) in the Solar system. Previous studies have tracked the triggering event to the earliest phases of collapse and have focused on the shock properties required for both successful star formation and mixing of SLRIs. In this paper, we use adaptive mesh refinement simulation methods, including sink particles, to simulate the full collapse and subsequent evolution of a stable Bonnor- Ebert sphere subjected to a shock and post-shock wind. We track the flow of the cloud material after a star (a sink particle) has formed. For non-rotating clouds, we find robust triggered collapse and little bound circumstellar material remaining around the post-shock collapsed core. When we add initial cloud rotation, we observe the formation of discs around the collapsed core which then interact with the post-shock flow. Our results indicate that these circumstellar discs are massive enough to form planets and are long lived, in spite of the ablation driven by post-shock-flow ram pressure. As a function of the initial conditions, we also track the time evolution of the accretion rates and particle mixing between the ambient wind and cloud material. The latter is maximized for cases of highest Mach number.},

abstract = {A possible origin of the iron-deficiency in PG1159 stars could be neutron captures on Fe nuclei. A nickel overabundance would corroborate this idea. Consequently we are looking for nickel lines in PG1159 stars. Prime targets are relatively cool objects, because Ni VI is the dominant ionisation stage and the spectral lines of this ion are accessible with UV observations. We do not find such lines in the coolest PG1159 star observed by FUSE (PG1707+427, Teff = 85 000 K) and conclude that the nickel abundance is not enhanced. Hence, the Fe-deficiency in PG1159 stars remains unexplained. In addition, we present results of a wind analysis of the hybrid-PG1159 star NGC 7094 and the [WC]--PG1159 transition-type object Abell 78 in order to derive F abundances from the F VI 1139.5 {\AA} line. In both cases, we find F overabundances, in agreement with results of photospheric analyses of many PG1159 stars. Surprisingly, we find indications for a very low O abundance in NGC 7094.},

abstract = {Simulations of nucleosynthesis in astrophysical environments are at the intersection of nuclear physics reaction rate research and astrophysical applications, for example in the area of galactic chemical evolution or near-field cosmology. Unfortunately, at present the available yields for such applications are based on heterogeneous assumptions between the various contributing nuclear production sites, both in terms of modeling the thermodynamic environment itself as well as the choice of specifc nuclear reaction rates and compilations. On the other side, new nuclear reaction rate determinations are often taking a long time to be included in astrophysical applications. The NuGrid project addresses these issues by providing a set of codes and a framework in which these codes interact. In this contribution we describe the motivation, goals and first results of the NuGrid project. At the core is a new and evolving post-processing nuclesoynthesis code (PPN) that can follow quiescent and explosive nucleosynthesis following multi-zone 1D-stellar evolution as well as multi-zone hydrodynamic input, including explosions. First results are available in the areas of AGB and massive stars.},

abstract = {Context. Galactic chemical evolution models are useful tools for interpreting the large body of high-quality observational data on the chemical composition of stars and gas in galaxies that have become available in recent years. Aims: This is the second paper of a series that aims at quantifying the uncertainties in chemical evolution model predictions related to the underlying model assumptions. Specifically, it deals with the uncertainties due to the choice of the stellar yields. Methods: We adopted a widely used model for the chemical evolution of the Galaxy to test the effects of changing the stellar nucleosynthesis prescriptions on the predicted evolution of several chemical species. Up-to-date results from stellar evolutionary models were carefully taken into account. Results: We find that, except for a handful of elements whose nucleosynthesis in stars is well understood by now, large uncertainties still affect model predictions. This is especially true for the majority of the iron-peak elements, but also for much more abundant species such as carbon and nitrogen. The main causes of the mismatch we find among the outputs of different models assuming different stellar yields and among model predictions and observations are (i) the adopted location of the mass cut in models of type II supernova explosions; (ii) the adopted strength and extent of hot bottom burning in models of asymptotic giant branch stars; (iii) the neglection of the effects of rotation on the chemical composition of the stellar surfaces; (iv) the adopted rates of mass loss and of (v) nuclear reactions; and (vi) the different treatments of convection. Conclusions: Our results suggest that it is mandatory to include processes such as hot bottom burning in intermediate-mass stars and rotation in stars of all masses in accurate studies of stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis. In spite of their importance, both these processes still have to be better understood and characterized. As for massive stars, presupernova models computed with mass loss and rotation are available in the literature, but they still wait for a self-consistent coupling with the results of explosive nucleosynthesis computations.},

abstract = {In Paper 1 (Groenewegen and de Jong (1993)) of this series we presented a model to calculate in a synthetic way the evolution of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. The model was applied to the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and values were derived for the minimum core mass for third dredge-up, the dredge-up efficiency and the Reimers mass loss rate coefficient on the AGB. The observed carbon star luminosity function, the C/M-star ratio and the initial-final mass relation acted as constraints. In this paper we compare the predicted and observed abundances of planetary nebulae (PNe) in the LMC for the final model of Paper 1(Groenewegen and de Jong (1993)). In general there is good agreement. The discrepancy between observations and predictions in the C/O-C/N diagram suggests that either the mass loss rate of the most massive stars is underestimated or that their is no dredge-up after hot-bottom burning ceases. From the N/O-N/H diagram we deduce that on the main sequence the ratio of the oxygen abundance to the total metallicity probably was higher in the past. This is consistent with observations of the oxygen abundance in the Galaxy as well as theoretical modelling of the chemical evolution for the LMC. The location of a PN in the N/O-He/H, C/O-He/H, C/O-C/N and N/O-N/H diagrams is a good indicator of the main-sequence mass. Our model predicts the high He/H and N/O ratios observed in some planetary nebulae.},

abstract = {Motivated by unexplained observations of low sulphur abundances in planetary nebulae (PNe) and the PG1159 class of post-asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, we investigate the possibility that sulphur may be destroyed by nucleosynthetic processes in low-to-intermediate mass stars during stellar evolution. We use a 3 M⊙, Z = 0.01 evolutionary sequence to examine the consequences of high and low reaction rate estimates of neutron captures on to sulphur and neighbouring elements. In addition, we have also tested high and low rates for the neutron producing reactions 13C($\alpha$,n)16O and 22Ne($\alpha$,n)25Mg. We vary the mass width of a partially mixed zone (PMZ), which is responsible for the formation of a 13C pocket and is the site of the 13C($\alpha$,n)16O neutron source. We test PMZ masses from zero up to an extreme upper limit of the entire He-intershell mass at 10-2 M⊙. We find that the alternative reaction rates and variations to the PMZ have almost no effect on surface sulphur abundances and do not reproduce the anomaly. To understand the effect of initial mass on our conclusions, 1.8 and 6 M⊙ evolutionary sequences are also tested with similar results for sulphur abundances. We are able to set a constraint on the size of the PMZ, as PMZ sizes that are greater than half of the He-intershell mass (in the 3 M⊙ model) are excluded by comparison with neon abundances in PNe. We compare the 1.8 M⊙ model's intershell abundances with observations of PG1159-035, whose surface abundances are thought to reflect the intershell composition of a progenitor AGB star. We find general agreement between the patterns of F, Ne, Si, P and Fe abundances and a very large discrepancy for sulphur where our model predicts abundances that are 30-40 times higher than those observed in the star.},

All the models have deep third dredge-up, hot bottom burning, and mass loss. Calculations have been performed using the two most commonly used estimates of the 22Ne+$\alpha$ rates as well as the new recommended rates, and with combinations of their upper and lower limits. The main result of the present study is that, with the new rates, uncertainties on the production of isotopes from Mg to P coming from the 22Ne+$\alpha$-capture rates have been considerably reduced. We have therefore removed one of the important sources of uncertainty to effect models of AGB stars. We have studied the effects of varying the mass-loss rate on nucleosynthesis and discuss other uncertainties related to the physics employed in the computation of stellar structure, such as the modeling of convection, the inclusion of a partial mixing zone, and the definition of convective borders. These uncertainties are found to be much larger than those coming from 22Ne+$\alpha$-capture rates, when using our new estimates. Much effort is needed to improve the situation for AGB models.},

In addition, a large range in G band strength directly correlates with the Ca and cyanogen variations, C is overabundant relative to the heavy elements in a relatively high proportion of the stars in M22, and the behavior of C sets M22 and Omega Cen apart from the more normal clusters in such a way as to complicate and interpretation of CN variations.

We analyze the SDSS M-Z relation with 10 metallicity calibrations, including theoretical and empirical methods. We show that the choice of metallicity calibration has a significant effect on the shape and y-intercept [12+log(O/H)] of the M-Z relation. The absolute metallicity scale (y-intercept) varies up to $\Delta$[log(O/H)]=0.7 dex, depending on the calibration used, and the change in shape is substantial. These results indicate that it is critical to use the same metallicity calibration when comparing different luminosity-metallicity or M-Z relations. We present new metallicity conversions that allow metallicities that have been derived using different strong-line calibrations to be converted to the same base calibration. These conversions facilitate comparisons between different samples, particularly comparisons between galaxies at different redshifts for which different suites of emission lines are available. Our new conversions successfully remove the large 0.7 dex discrepancies between the metallicity calibrations, and we reach agreement in the M-Z relation to within 0.03 dex on average. We investigate the effect of AGN classification and aperture covering fraction on the M-Z relation. We find that different AGN classification methods have negligible effect on the SDSS M-Z relation. We compare the SDSS M-Z relation with nuclear and global relations from the NFGS. The turnover of the M-Z relation at M*{\textasciitilde}1010 Msolar depends on the aperture covering fraction. We find that a lower redshift limit of z<0.04 is insufficient for avoiding aperture effects in fiber spectra of the highest stellar mass (M*>1010 Msolar) galaxies.},

abstract = {It has recently been demonstrated that coherent relative streaming velocities of order 30 km s-1 between dark matter and gas permeated the universe on scales below a few Mpc directly after recombination. Here we use a series of high-resolution moving-mesh calculations to show that these supersonic motions significantly influence the virialization of the gas in minihalos and delay the formation of the first stars. As the gas streams into minihalos with bulk velocities around 1 km s-1 at z {\textasciitilde} 20, the additional momentum and energy input reduces the gas fractions and central densities of the halos, increasing the typical virial mass required for efficient cooling by a factor of three and delaying Population III star formation by $\Delta$z {\textasciitilde}= 4. Since the distribution of the magnitude of the streaming velocities is narrowly peaked around a non-negligible value, this effect is important in most regions of the universe. As a consequence, the increased minimum halo mass implies a reduction of the absolute number of minihalos that can be expected to cool and form Population III stars by up to an order of magnitude. We further find that the streaming velocities increase the turbulent velocity dispersion of the minihalo gas, which could affect its ability to fragment and hence alter the mass function of the first stars.},

We apply the new method of Burles {\&} Tytler to robustly determine D/H in high-resolution Lyalpha forest spectra and include a constraint on the neutral hydrogen column density determined from the Lyman continuum optical depth in low-resolution spectra. We introduce six separate models to measure D/H and to assess the systematic dependence on the assumed underlying parameters. We find that the deuterium absorption feature contains a small amount of contamination from unrelated H I. Including the effects of the contamination, we calculate the 67% confidence interval of D/H in this absorption system, log (D/H)=-4.40^+0.06_-0.08. This measurement agrees with the low measurement by Burles {\&} Tytler toward Q1937-1009, and the combined value gives the best determination of primordial D/H, log (D/H)_p=-4.47^+0.030_-0.035 or D/H = 3.39 +/- 0.25 x 10^-5. Predictions from standard big bang nucleosynthesis give the cosmological baryon-to-photon ratio, eta = 5.1 +/- 0.3 x 10^-10, and the baryon density in units of the critical density, Omega_bh^2 = 0.019 +/- 0.001, where H_0 = 100h km s^-1 Mpc^-1. The measured value of (D/H)_p implies that the primordial abundances of both ^4He and ^7Li are high and consistent with some recent studies. Our two low measurements of primordial D/H also place strong constraints on inhomogeneous models of big bang nucleosynthesis.},

abstract = {The combination of seven-year data from WMAP and improved astrophysical data rigorously tests the standard cosmological model and places new constraints on its basic parameters and extensions. By combining the WMAP data with the latest distance measurements from the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in the distribution of galaxies and the Hubble constant (H 0) measurement, we determine the parameters of the simplest six-parameter $\Lambda$CDM model. The power-law index of the primordial power spectrum is ns = 0.968 {\textpm} 0.012 (68% CL) for this data combination, a measurement that excludes the Harrison-Zel'dovich-Peebles spectrum by 99.5% CL. The other parameters, including those beyond the minimal set, are also consistent with, and improved from, the five-year results. We find no convincing deviations from the minimal model. The seven-year temperature power spectrum gives a better determination of the third acoustic peak, which results in a better determination of the redshift of the matter-radiation equality epoch. Notable examples of improved parameters are the total mass of neutrinos, $\sum$m $\nu$ < 0.58 eV(95%CL), and the effective number of neutrino species, N eff = 4.34+0.86 -0.88 (68% CL), which benefit from better determinations of the third peak and H 0. The limit on a constant dark energy equation of state parameter from WMAP+BAO+H 0, without high-redshift Type Ia supernovae, is w = -1.10 {\textpm} 0.14 (68% CL). We detect the effect of primordial helium on the temperature power spectrum and provide a new test of big bang nucleosynthesis by measuring Yp = 0.326 {\textpm} 0.075 (68% CL). We detect, and show on the map for the first time, the tangential and radial polarization patterns around hot and cold spots of temperature fluctuations, an important test of physical processes at z = 1090 and the dominance of adiabatic scalar fluctuations. The seven-year polarization data have significantly improved: we now detect the temperature-E-mode polarization cross power spectrum at 21$\sigma$, compared with 13$\sigma$ from the five-year data. With the seven-year temperature-B-mode cross power spectrum, the limit on a rotation of the polarization plane due to potential parity-violating effects has improved by 38% to $\Delta$ $\alpha$ =-1.1{\textpm} 1.4{\textdegree} statistical {\textpm} 1.5 systematic (68% CL). We report significant detections of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect at the locations of known clusters of galaxies. The measured SZ signal agrees well with the expected signal from the X-ray data on a cluster-by-cluster basis. However, it is a factor of 0.5-0.7 times the predictions from "universal profile" of Arnaud et al., analytical models, and hydrodynamical simulations. We find, for the first time in the SZ effect, a significant difference between the cooling-flow and non-cooling-flow clusters (or relaxed and non-relaxed clusters), which can explain some of the discrepancy. This lower amplitude is consistent with the lower-than-theoretically expected SZ power spectrum recently measured by the South Pole Telescope Collaboration. WMAP is the result of a partnership between Princeton University and NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. Scientific guidance is provided by the WMAP Science Team.},

abstract = {Recent studies suggest that the helium content of multiple stellar populations in globular clusters (GCs) is not uniform. The range of helium varies from cluster to cluster with more massive GCs having, preferentially, large helium spread. GCs with large helium variations also show extended-blue horizontal branch (HB). I exploit Hubble Space Telescope photometry to investigate multiple stellar populations in NGC 6266 and infer their relative helium abundance. This cluster is an ideal target to investigate the possible connection between helium, cluster mass, and HB morphology, as it exhibits an extended HB and is among the 10 more luminous GCs in the Milky Way. The analysis of colour-magnitude diagrams from multiwavelength photometry reveals that also NGC 6266, similarly to other massive GCs, hosts a double main sequence (MS), with the red and the blue component made up of the 79 {\textpm} 1 per cent and the 21 {\textpm} 1 per cent of stars, respectively. The red MS is consistent with a stellar population with primordial helium while the blue MS is highly helium-enhanced by $\Delta$Y = 0.08 {\textpm} 0.01. Furthermore, the red MS exhibits an intrinsic broadening that cannot be attributed to photometric errors only and is consistent with a spread in helium of {\~{ }}0.025 dex. The comparison between NGC 6266 and other GCs hosting helium-enriched stellar populations supports the presence of a correlation among helium variations, cluster mass, and HB extension.},

Altogether 78 different model supernova explosions are calculated. In each case nucleosynthesis has already been determined for 200 isotopes in each of 600 to 1200 zones of the presupernova star, including the effects of time dependent convection. Here each star is exploded using a piston to give a specified final kinetic energy at infinity (typically 1.2 {\texttimes} 1051 ergs), and the explosive modifications to the nucleosynthesis, including the effects of neutrino irradiation, determined. A single value of the critical 12C($\alpha$,$\gamma$) 16O reaction rate corresponding to 8(300 keV) = 170 keV barns is used in all calculations. The synthesis of each isotope is discussed along with its sensitivity to model parameters. In each case, the final mass of the collapsed remnant is also determined and often found not to correspond to the location of the piston (typically the edge of the iron core), but to a "mass cut" farther out. This mass cut is sensitive not only to the explosion energy, but also to the presupernova structure, stellar mass, and the metallicity. Unless the explosion mechanism, for unknown reasons, provides a much larger characteristic energy in more massive stars, it appears likely that stars larger than about 30 Msun will experience considerable reimplosion of heavy elements following the initial launch of a successful shock. While such explosions will produce a viable, bright Type II supernova light curve, lacking perhaps the radioactive tail, they will have dramatically reduced yields of heavy elements and may leave black hole remnants of up to 10 and more solar masses. The production of black holes may be particularly favored for stars of low metallicity, both because of their more compact structure and reduced mass loss.},

This is due to mass-loss reducing the envelope mass so that HBB ceases but dredge-up continues. The high mass-loss rate produces an optically thick wind before the star reaches C/O>1. This is consistent with the recent results of van Loon et al. (1997a,b) who find obscured C stars in the Magellanic Clouds at luminosities up to Mbol =3D -6.8.},

abstract = {The stellar initial mass function (IMF) plays a crucial role in the determination of the number of surviving stars in galaxies, of the chemical composition of the interstellar medium and of the distribution of light in galaxies. A key unsolved question is whether the IMF is universal in time and space. Here, we use the state-of-the-art results of stellar evolution to show that the IMF of our Galaxy made a transition from an IMF dominated by massive stars to the present-day IMF at an early phase of the Galaxy formation. Updated results from stellar evolution in a wide range of metallicities have been implemented in a binary population synthesis code, and compared with the observations of carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars in our Galaxy. We find that the application of the present-day IMF to Galactic halo stars causes serious contradictions with four observable quantities connected with the evolution of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. Furthermore, a comparison between our calculations and the observations of CEMP stars might help us to constrain the transition metallicity for the IMF, which we tentatively set at [Fe/H] $\approx$-2. A novelty of the current study is the inclusion of mass-loss suppression in intermediate-mass AGB stars at low metallicity. This significantly reduces the overproduction of nitrogen-enhanced stars, which was a major problem in previous studies when using the IMF dominated by high-mass stars. Our results also demonstrate that the use of the present-day IMF for all time in chemical evolution models results in the overproduction of Type I.5 supernovae. More data on stellar abundances will help us to understand how the IMF has changed, and what caused such a transition.},

These stars of low mass (M {\textasciitilde} 0.9Msolar) are located on the main-sequence or the red-giant phase, and do not undergo third dredge-up (TDU) episodes. The s-process enhancement is most plausibly due to accretion in a binary system from a more massive companion when on the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase (now a white dwarf). In order to interpret the spectroscopic observations, updated AGB models are needed to follow in detail the s-process nucleosynthesis. We present nucleosynthesis calculations based on AGB stellar models obtained with Frascati Raphson-Newton Evolutionary Code (FRANEC) for low initial stellar masses and low metallicities. For a given metallicity, a wide spread in the abundance of the s-process elements is obtained by varying the amount of 13C and its profile in the pocket, where the 13C($\alpha$, n)16O reaction is the major neutron source, releasing neutrons in radiative conditions during the interpulse phase. We also account for the second neutron source 22Ne($\alpha$, n)25Mg, partially activated during convective thermal pulses. We discuss the surface abundance of elements from carbon to bismuth, for AGB models of initial masses M = 1.3-2Msolar, low metallicities ([Fe/H] from -1 down to -3.6) and for different 13C-pocket efficiencies. In particular, we analyse the relative behaviour of the three s-process peaks: light-s (ls at magic neutron number N = 50), heavy-s (hs at N = 82) and lead (N = 126). Two s-process indicators, [hs/ls] and [Pb/hs], are needed in order to characterize the s-process distribution. In the on-line material, we provide a set of data tables with surface predictions. Our final objective is to provide a full set of theoretical models of low-mass low-metallicity s-process-enhanced stars. In a forthcoming paper, we will test our results through a comparison with observations of CEMP-s stars.},

abstract = {We propose that the abundance anomalies of proton-capture elements in globular clusters, such as the C-N, Na-O, Mg-Al and Na-F anticorrelations, were produced by supermassive stars with M {\~{ }} 104 M⊙. Such stars could form in the runaway collisions of massive stars that sank to the cluster centre as a result of dynamical friction, or via the direct monolithic collapse of the low-metallicity gas cloud from which the cluster formed. To explain the observed abundance anomalies, we assume that the supermassive stars had lost significant parts of their initial masses when only a small mass fraction of hydrogen, $\Delta$X {\~{ }} 0.15, was transformed into helium. We speculate that the required mass-loss might be caused by the super-Eddington radiation continuum-driven stellar wind or by the diffusive mode of the Jeans instability.},

Confidence limits are derived on the absolute V-band magnitude of the bump in the red giant branch luminosity function (MV,b) and the excess number of stars in the bump, Rb. The analysis takes into account uncertainties in the primordial helium abundance, abundance of $\alpha$-capture elements, radiative and conductive opacities, nuclear reaction rates, neutrino energy losses, the treatments of diffusion and convection, the surface boundary conditions, and color transformations. The uncertainty in theoretical values for the red giant bump magnitude varies with metallicity between +0.13 and -0.12 mag at [Fe/H]=-2.4 and between +0.23 and -0.21 mag at [Fe/H]=-1.0. The dominant sources of uncertainty are the abundance of the $\alpha$-capture elements , the mixing length, and the low-temperature opacities. The theoretical values of MV,b are in good agreement with observations. The uncertainty in the theoretical value of Rb is +/-0.01 at all metallicities studied. The dominant sources of uncertainty are the abundance of the $\alpha$-capture elements, the mixing length, and the high-temperature opacities. The median value of Rb varies from 0.44 at [Fe/H]=-2.4 to 0.50 at [Fe/H]=-1.0. These theoretical values for Rb are in agreement with observations.},

abstract = {Globular star clusters are compact and massive stellar systems old enough to have witnessed the entire history of our Galaxy, the Milky Way. Although recent results suggest that their formation may have been more complex than previously thought, they still are the best approximation to a stellar population formed over a relatively short timescale (less than 1Gyr) and with virtually no dispersion in the iron content. Indeed, only one cluster-like system ($\omega$ Centauri) in the Galactic halo is known to have multiple stellar populations with a significant spread in iron abundance and age. Similar findings in the Galactic bulge have been hampered by the obscuration arising from thick and varying layers of interstellar dust. Here we report that Terzan 5, a globular-cluster-like system in the Galactic bulge, has two stellar populations with different iron contents and ages. Terzan 5 could be the surviving remnant of one of the primordial building blocks that are thought to merge and form galaxy bulges.},

abstract = {Globular cluster (GC) color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) are reasonably well understood in terms of standard stellar evolution. However, there are still some open issues, such as fully accounting for the horizontal branch (HB) morphology in terms of chemical and dynamical parameters. Mass loss on the red giant branch (RGB) shapes the mass distribution of the HB stars, and the color distribution in turn. The physical mechanisms driving mass loss are still unclear, as direct observations fail to reveal a clear correlation between mass-loss rate and stellar properties. The HB mass distribution is further complicated by helium-enhanced multiple stellar populations due to differences in the evolving mass along the HB. We present a simple analytical mass-loss model based on tidal stripping through Roche-Lobe overflow during stellar encounters. Our model naturally results in a non-Gaussian mass-loss distribution with high skewness and contains only two free parameters. We fit it to the HB mass distribution of four Galactic GCs, as obtained from fitting the CMD with zero age HB models. The best-fit model accurately reproduces the observed mass distribution. If confirmed on a wider sample of GCs, our results would account for the effects of dynamics in RGB mass-loss processes and provide a physically motivated procedure for synthetic CMDs of GCs. Our physical modeling of mass loss may result in the ability to disentangle the effects of dynamics and helium-enhanced multiple populations on the HB morphology and is instrumental in making HB morphology a probe of the dynamical state of GCs, leading to an improved understanding of their evolution.},

This study uses the state-of-the-art carbon-rich atmosphere models and improved atomic and molecular line lists in the 2.3 $\mu$m region. Significantly lower F abundances are obtained in comparison to previous studies in the literature. This difference is mainly due to molecular blends. In the case of carbon stars of SC-type, differences in the model atmospheres are also relevant. The new F enhancements are now in agreement with the most recent theoretical nucleosynthesis models in low-mass AGB stars, solving the long-standing problem of F in Galactic AGB stars. Nevertheless, some SC-type carbon stars still show larger F abundances than predicted by stellar models. The possibility that these stars are of larger mass is briefly discussed.},

In this Letter, we show that stars belonging to the newly discovered metal-rich population have a coherent bulk motion with respect to the other cluster stars, thus demonstrating that they formed in an independent self-gravitating stellar system. This is the first clear-cut evidence that extreme metal-rich stars were part of a small stellar system (a satellite of $\omega$ Centauri?) that has been accreted by the main body of the cluster. In this case, we are witnessing an in vivo example of hierarchical merging on the subgalactic scale.},

The basic data were high-resolution, low-noise coude spectra in the 6700 A spectral region. Abundances of iron and calcium, derived from one Ca I and several Fe I lines in our spectra, provided a metallicity discriminant for the stars in our sample. The subgiants with temperatures between 5500 and 4900 K show a steady decline of lithium abundance with advancing subgiant position (and decreasing temperature). The observed trend is in qualitative agreement with recent theoretical models of lithium dilution in metal-poor stars, especially if main-sequence diffusion is included. The initial lithium abundances in metal-poor stars may have been slightly larger than that exhibited by stars near the main-sequence turnoff. For stars with temperatures below 4900 K, the models predict no further dilution, but observed lithium abundances continue to decline with decreasing temperature, indicating further lithium destruction on the giant branch of metal-poor stars. In all postdilution subgiants, the observed lithium abundances show more scatter than do stars at the main-sequence turnoff, suggesting variations in the main-sequence lithium destruction below the observable surface layers.},

Theoretical calculations by Iben (1974, 1975, 1976) have shown that a 'dredge-up' process can bring to the surface of an AGB star some of the fresh carbon that is formed in the helium- and carbon-rich convective shell during a thermal pulse, and that this process will ultimately lead to the development of C star characteristics. The investigation demonstrates that, if the observations are to be understood, significant dredge-up must occur in thermally pulsing ABG stars of low metal abundances when core mass is considerably smaller than 0.6 solar masses. The discussion which focuses on the properties of a homogeneous and complete sample of C stars whose distances are well known, is complementary to a recent study by Scalo and Miller (1979), which focuses on the properties of C stars in the Galaxy.},

abstract = {We have investigated the color-magnitude diagram of $\omega$ Centauri and find that the blue main sequence (bMS) can be reproduced only by models that have a helium abundance in the range Y = 0.35-0.40. To explain the faint subgiant branch of the reddest stars ("MS-a/RG-a" sequence), isochrones for the observed metallicity ([Fe/H] $\approx$-0.7) appear to require both a high age ({\textasciitilde}13 Gyr) and enhanced CNO abundances ([CNO/Fe] $\approx$0.9). Y $\approx$ 0.35 must also be assumed in order to counteract the effects of high CNO on turnoff colors and thereby to obtain a good fit to the relatively blue turnoff of this stellar population. This suggests a short chemical evolution period of time (<1 Gyr) for $\omega$ Cen. Our intermediate-mass (super-)asymptotic giant branch (AGB) models are able to reproduce the high helium abundances, along with [N/Fe] {\textasciitilde}2 and substantial O depletions if uncertainties in the treatment of convection are fully taken into account. These abundance features distinguish the bMS stars from the dominant [Fe/H] $\approx$-1.7 population. The most massive super-AGB stellar models (M ZAMS >= 6.8 M ⊙, M He, core >= 1.245 M ⊙) predict too large N enhancements, which limit their role in contributing to the extreme populations. In order to address the observed central concentration of stars with He-rich abundance, we show here quantitatively that highly He- and N-enriched AGB ejecta have particularly efficient cooling properties. Based on these results and on the reconstruction of the orbit of $\omega$ Cen with respect to the Milky Way, we propose the Galactic plane passage gas purging scenario for the chemical evolution of this cluster. The bMS population formed shortly after the purging of most of the cluster gas as a result of the passage of $\omega$ Cen through the Galactic disk (which occurs today every {\textasciitilde}40 Myr for $\omega$ Cen) when the initial mass function of the dominant population had "burned" through most of the Type II supernova mass range. AGB stars would eject most of their masses into the gas-depleted cluster through low-velocity winds that sink to the cluster core due to their favorable cooling properties and form the bMS population. In our discussion we follow our model through four passage events, which could explain some key properties not only of the bMS but also of the MS-a/RGB-a and the s-enriched stars.},

abstract = {We have obtained uvbyCa data for over 300 giants and horizontal-branch stars in three fields of M22. The spread in (b - y) for the giant and horizontal branches is consistent with a spread in foreground reddening delta E (B - V) is approximately equal to 0.08. Reanalysis of the data of Norris and Freeman (1983) indicates not only positive correlations between CH, CN, and Ca, but decidely bimodal distributions of CH and CN and a unimodal distribution for Ca. Our photometric indices, m1 and hk, demonstrate a range in metallicity that persists to two magnitudes below the horizontal branch, and confirms the correlation between calcium abundance and CN/CH. We infer from comparisons to spectroscopic data that m1 is dominated by the CN and CH abundance and find no independent evidence of a range in (Fe/H). The excessive ranges in m1 and hk also suggest the influence of a continuous opacity source, reminiscent of the Bond-Neff effect, that is correlated with CNO abundance. The relative contributions of internal mixing and primordial variations for M22's giants are discussed.},

abstract = {Context. Degenerate ignition of helium in low-mass stars at the end of the red giant branch phase leads to dynamic convection in their helium cores. One-dimensional (1D) stellar modeling of this intrinsically multi-dimensional dynamic event is likely to be inadequate. Previous hydrodynamic simulations imply that the single convection zone in the helium core of metal-rich Pop I stars grows during the flash on a dynamic timescale. This may lead to hydrogen injection into the core and to a double convection zone structure as known from one-dimensional core helium flash simulations of low-mass Pop III stars. Aims: We perform hydrodynamic simulations of the core helium flash in two and three dimensions to better constrain the nature of these events. To this end we study the hydrodynamics of convection within the helium cores of a 1.25 M_⊙ metal-rich Pop I star (Z = 0.02), and, for the first time, a 0.85 M_⊙ metal-free Pop III star (Z = 0) near the peak of the flash. These models possess single and double convection zones, respectively. Methods: We use 1D stellar models of the core helium flash computed with state-of-the-art stellar evolution codes as initial models for our multidimensional hydrodynamic study, and simulate the evolution of these models with the Riemann solver based hydrodynamics code Herakles, which integrates the Euler equations coupled with source terms corresponding to gravity and nuclear burning. Results: The hydrodynamic simulation of the Pop I model involving a single convection zone covers 27 h of stellar evolution, while the hydrodynamic simulations of a double convection zone, in the Pop III model, span 1.8 h of stellar life. We find differences between the predictions of mixing length theory and our hydrodynamic simulations. The simulation of the single convection zone in the Pop I model shows a strong growth of the size of the convection zone due to turbulent entrainment. We therefore predict that for the Pop I model a hydrogen injection phase (i.e., hydrogen injection into the helium core) will commence after about 23 days, which should eventually lead to a double convection zone structure known from 1D stellar modeling of low-mass Pop III stars. Our two and three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of the double (Pop III) convection zone model show that the velocity field in the convection zones is different from that given by stellar evolutionary calculations. The simulations suggest that the double convection zone decays quickly, the flow eventually being dominated by internal gravity waves. The decay could be an artefact caused by the mapping of the initial stellar model to the numerical grid of our hydrodynamics code.},

abstract = {The production of deuterium, He3, lithium, beryllium, and boron by galactic cosmic rays in the interstellar medium, over the life of the Galaxy, is calculated. It is found that high-energy $\alpha$-$\alpha$ reactions contribute in an essential way to the observed lithium. When allowance is made for the interchange of material between stars and the interstellar gas and for the change of cosmic-ray intensity with time, the Li6, Be9, and boron produced turn out to be ample to explain the observed abundances, and with remarkable internal consistency. Deuterium and He3 arenot produced in significant amounts, nor Li7 in sufficient amount, however. To explain the Li7/Li6 ratio measured terrestrially and in chondritic meteorites, we invoke cosmological production of Li7. This implies the production of deuterium, He3, and He4 as well, in amounts consistent with observation. The theory in its present form cannot explain a solar-system Li7/Li6 ratio of 12and stellar ratios as low as 3, but additional processes can be adduced to reconcile them. The consistency of the numbers when cosmological production is included lends additional support to the big-bang hypothesis. An incidental result is that the mean luminosity of the Galaxy over its lifetime has been about 3 times its present luminosity.},

A spectrum at 5 days past B-band maximum light is a direct match to the super-Chandrasekhar-mass candidate SN Ia 2003fg, showing Si II and C II at {\textasciitilde}9000 km s-1. A high signal-to-noise co-addition of the SN spectral time series reveals no Na I D absorption, suggesting negligible reddening in the host galaxy, and the late-time color evolution has the same slope as the Lira relation for normal SNe Ia. The ejecta appear to be well mixed, with no strong maximum in I band and a diversity of iron-peak lines appearing in near-maximum-light spectra. SN 2007if also displays a plateau in the Si II velocity extending as late as +10 days, which we interpret as evidence for an overdense shell in the SN ejecta. We calculate the bolometric light curve of the SN and use it and the Si II velocity evolution to constrain the mass of the shell and the underlying SN ejecta, and demonstrate that SN 2007if is strongly inconsistent with a Chandrasekhar-mass scenario. Within the context of a "tamped detonation" model appropriate for double-degenerate mergers, and assuming no host extinction, we estimate the total mass of the system to be 2.4 {\textpm} 0.2 M sun, with 1.6 {\textpm} 0.1 M sun of 56Ni and with 0.3-0.5 M sun in the form of an envelope of unburned carbon/oxygen. Our modeling demonstrates that the kinematics of shell entrainment provide a more efficient mechanism than incomplete nuclear burning for producing the low velocities typical of super-Chandrasekhar-mass SNe Ia.},

abstract = {Using our non-local time-dependent theory of convection, the linear non-adiabatic oscillations of 10 evolutionary model series with masses of 1-3 Msolar are calculated. The results show that there is a red giant instability strip in the lower temperature side of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram which goes along the sequences of the red giant branch and the asymptotic giant branch. For red giants of lower luminosities, pulsation instability is found at high order overtones; the lower order modes from the fundamental to the second overtone are stable. Towards higher luminosity and lower effective temperature, instability moves to lower order modes, and the amplitude growth rate of oscillations also grows. At the high luminosity end of the strip, the fundamental and the first overtone become unstable, while all the modes above the fourth order become stable. The excitation mechanisms have been studied in detail. It is found that turbulent pressure plays a key role for excitation of red variables. The frozen convection approximation is unavailable for the low temperature stars with extended convective envelopes. In any case, this approximation can explain neither the red edge of the Cepheid instability strip, nor the blue edge of the pulsating red giant instability strip. An analytic expression of a pulsation constant as a function of stellar mass, luminosity and effective temperature is presented from this work.},

abstract = {As part of a larger program aimed at better quantifying the uncertainties in stellar computations, we attempt to calibrate the extent of convective overshooting in low to intermediate mass stars by means of eclipsing binary systems. We model 12 such systems, with component masses between 1.3 and 6.2M⊙, using the detailed binary stellar evolution code STARS, producing grids of models in both metallicity and overshooting parameter. From these, we determine the best fit parameters for each of our systems. For three systems, none of our models produce a satisfactory fit. For the remaining systems, no single value for the convective overshooting parameter fits all the systems, but most of our systems can be well described with an overshooting parameter between 0.09 and 0.15, corresponding to an extension of the mixed region above the core of about 0.1-0.3 pressure scale heights. Of the nine systems where we are able to obtain a good fit, seven can be reasonably well fit with a single parameter of 0.15. We find no evidence for a trend of the extent of overshooting with either mass or metallicity, though the data set is of limited size. We repeat our calculations with a second evolution code, MESA, and we find general agreement between the two codes. The extension of the mixed region above the convective core required by the MESA models is about 0.15-0.4 pressure scale heights. For the system EI Cep, we find that MESA gives an overshooting region that is larger than the STARS one by about 0.1 pressure scale heights for the primary, while for the secondary the difference is only 0.05 pressure scale heights.},

In our previous studies we used the Vassiliadis {\&} Wood mass-loss rate, which stays low until the pulsation period reaches 500 days after which point a superwind begins. Vassiliadis {\&} Wood noted that for stars over 2.5 M {\&}sun; the superwind should be delayed until P $\approx$ 750 days at 5 M {\&}sun;. We calculate evolutionary sequences where we delay the onset of the superwind to pulsation periods of P $\approx$ 700-800 days in models of M = 5, 6, and 7 M {\&}sun;. Post-processing nucleosynthesis calculations show that the 6 and 7 M {\&}sun; models produce the most Rb, with [Rb/Fe] $\approx$1 dex, close to the average of most of the Galactic Rb-rich stars ([Rb/Fe] $\approx$1.4 {\textpm} 0.8 dex). Changing the rate of the 22Ne +$\alpha$ reactions results in variations of [Rb/Fe] as large as 0.5 dex in models with a delayed superwind. The largest enrichment in heavy elements is found for models that adopt the NACRE rate of the 22Ne($\alpha$, n)25Mg reaction. Using this rate allows us to best match the composition of most of the Rb-rich stars. A synthetic evolution algorithm is then used to remove the remaining envelope resulting in final [Rb/Fe] of $\approx$1.4 dex although with C/O ratios >1. We conclude that delaying the superwind may account for the large Rb overabundances observed in the brightest metal-rich AGB stars.},

The evolution of carbon-oxygen white dwarf models accreting helium in binary systems was computed using a Henyey-type hybrid method including both thermal and hydrodynamical equations. It is found that type I supernovae can be triggered by the off-center detonation of helium in systems with slow or intermediate accretion rates, or by the central carbon flash for slow or rapid accretion rates. Both helium detonation and carbon deflagration are possible for the case of slow accretion rates due to the importance of initial mass in determining the mode of ignition. Attention is also given to possible mechanisms for the building up of the helium zone surrounding the white dwarf, including direct transfer of helium from the companion star and hydrogen shell burning by processes depending on the accretion rate.},

Using infrared Ca II triplet lines, we derived metallicities and radial velocities for more than 250 stars belonging to different stellar populations of the system. We find that the most metal-rich component, the anomalous subgiant branch (SGB-a), has a metallicity of [Fe/H]{\textasciitilde}-0.6, fully compatible with that determined along the anomalous red giant branch (RGB-a). Our analysis suggests that the age of this component and of the other metal-intermediate (-1.4<[Fe/H]<-1.0) stellar populations of the system are all comparable to that of the dominant metal-poor population within 2 Gyr, regardless of the choice of helium abundance. These results impose severe constraints on the timescale of the enrichment process of this stellar system, excluding the possibility of an extended star formation period. The radial velocity analysis of the entire sample demonstrates that only metal-intermediate populations are kinematically cooler than the others.

abstract = {Context. Red giants are evolved stars that exhibit solar-like oscillations. Although a multitude of stars have been observed with space telescopes, only a handful of red giant stars were targets of spectroscopic asteroseismic observing projects. Aims: We search for solar-like oscillations in the two bright red giant stars $\gamma$ Psc and $\theta$1 Tau from a time series of ground-based spectroscopy and determine the frequency of the excess of oscillation power $\nu$max and the mean large frequency separation $\Delta$$\nu$ for both stars. Seismic constraints on the stellar mass and radius will provide robust input for stellar modelling. Methods: The radial velocities of $\gamma$ Psc and $\theta$1 Tau were monitored for 120 and 190 days, respectively. Nearly 9000 spectra were obtained. To reach accurate radial velocities, we used simultaneous thorium-argon and iodine-cell calibration of our optical spectra. In addition to the spectroscopy, we acquired interferometric observations of $\gamma$ Psc for an independent estimate of the radius. We also analysed 22 days of observations of $\theta$1 Tau with the MOST satellite. Results: The frequency analysis of the radial velocity data of $\gamma$ Psc revealed an excess of oscillation power around 32 $\mu$Hz and a large frequency separation of 4.1 {\textpm} 0.1 $\mu$Hz. $\theta$1 Tau exhibits oscillation power around 90 $\mu$Hz, with a large frequency separation of 6.9 {\textpm} 0.2 $\mu$Hz. Scaling relations indicate that $\gamma$ Psc is a star of about 1 M⊙ and 10 R⊙. The object $\theta$1 Tau appears to be a massive star of about 2.7 M⊙ and 10 R⊙. The radial velocities of both stars were found to be modulated on timescales much longer than the oscillation periods. Conclusions: The estimated radii from seismology are in agreement with interferometric observations and also with estimates based on photometric data. While the mass of $\theta$1 Tau is in agreement with results from dynamical parallaxes, we find a lower mass for $\gamma$ Psc than is found in the literature. The long periodic variability agrees with the expected timescales of rotational modulation.

abstract = {Sequence E variables are close binary red giants that show ellipsoidal light variations. They are likely the immediate precursors of planetary nebulae (PNe) with close binary central stars as well as other binary post-asymptotic giant branch (post-AGB) and binary post-red giant branch (post-RGB) stars. We have made a Monte Carlo simulation to determine the fraction of red giant binaries that go through a common envelope event leading to the production of a close binary system or a merged star. The novel aspect of this simulation is that we use the observed frequency of sequence E binaries in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) to normalize our calculations. This normalization allows us to produce predictions that are relatively independent of model assumptions. In our standard model, and assuming that the relative numbers of PNe of various types are proportional to their birth rates, we find that in the LMC today the fraction of PNe with close binary central stars is 7-9 per cent, the fraction of PNe with intermediate period binary central stars having separations capable of influencing the nebula shape (orbital periods less than 500 yr) is 23-27 per cent, the fraction of PNe containing wide binaries that are unable to influence the nebula shape (orbital period greater than 500 yr) is 46-55 per cent, the fraction of PNe derived from single stars is 3-19 per cent, and 5-6 per cent of PNe are produced by previously merged stars. We also predict that the birth rate of post-RGB stars is {\~{ }}4 per cent of the total PN birth rate, equivalent to {\~{ }}50 per cent of the production rate of PNe with close binary central stars. These post-RGB stars most likely appear initially as luminous low-mass helium white dwarf binaries. The average lifetime of sequence E ellipsoidal variability with amplitude more than 0.02 mag is predicted to be {\~{ }}0.95 Myr. We use our model and the observed number of red giant stars in the top one magnitude of the RGB in the LMC to predict the number of PNe in the LMC. We predict 548 PNe in good agreement with the 541 {\textpm} 89 PNe observed by Reid {\&} Parker. Since most of these PNe come from single or non-interacting binary stars in our model, this means that most such stars produce PNe contrary to the 'binary hypothesis' which suggests that binary interaction is required to produce a PN.},

abstract = {High-dispersion near-infrared spectra have been taken of seven highly evolved, variable, intermediate-mass (4-6 Msolar) asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud and Small Magellanic Cloud in order to look for C, N and O variations that are expected to arise from third dredge-up and hot-bottom burning. The pulsation of the objects has been modelled, yielding stellar masses, and spectral synthesis calculations have been performed in order to derive abundances from the observed spectra. For two stars, abundances of C, N, O, Na, Al, Ti, Sc and Fe were derived and compared with the abundances predicted by detailed AGB models. Both stars show very large N enhancements and C deficiencies. These results provide the first observational confirmation of the long-predicted production of primary nitrogen by the combination of third dredge-up and hot-bottom burning in intermediate-mass AGB stars. It was not possible to derive abundances for the remaining five stars: three were too cool to model, while another two had strong shocks in their atmospheres which caused strong emission to fill the line cores and made abundance determination impossible. The latter occurrence allows us to predict the pulsation phase interval during which observations should be made if successful abundance analysis is to be possible.},

Maximum-likelihood regression of helium against both oxygen and nitrogen are found to be quite accurately linear up to 10 exp 6, provided that H II galaxies known to have broad WR emission features are excluded; the latter often show upward deviations from the helium abundance found for other objects with the same oxygen and sometimes with the same nitrogen abundance. This supports an earlier suggestion that there may be additional local sources of both helium and nitrogen in the form of winds from Wolf-Rayet stars or their red supergiant progenitors.},

abstract = {It is demonstrated that deep circulation mixing below the base of the standard convective envelope, and the consequent ``cool bottom processing'' (CBP) of the CNO isotopes, can reproduce the trend with stellar mass of the ^12C/^13C observations in low-mass red giants. (This trend is opposite to what is expected from standard first dredge-up.) Our models assume that extra mixing always reaches to the same distance in temperature from the H-burning shell and that CBP begins when the H-burning shell erases the molecular weight discontinuity (``mu-barrier'') established by first dredge-up. For Population I stars, none of the other CNO isotopes except ^15N are expected to be altered by CBP. (If ^18O depletion occurs on the asymptotic giant branch [AGB], as some observations suggest, it would require that extra mixing reach closer to the H-burning shell on the AGB than on the red giant branch [RGB]-and should also result in a much lower ^12C/^13C ratio than is observed in the relevant AGB stars.) CBP increases dramatically as one reduces the stellar mass or metallicity-roughly as M^-2 on the RGB, because of the longer RGB of low-mass stars, and roughly as Z^-1, because of the higher H-shell burning temperatures of low-metallicity stars. In low-mass Population II stars, all the CNO isotopes are expected to be significantly altered by CBP. Field Population II stars exhibit RGB abundances consistent with the predictions of our CBP models that have been normalized to reproduce the Population I RGB abundances. On the other hand, globular cluster stars are observed to encounter much more extensive processing; additionally, CBP is observed to start near the base of the globular cluster RGB (overcoming any ``mu-barrier''). For the CNO isotopes ^12C, ^13C, ^14N, ^16O, ^17O, and ^18O, we also present self-consistent calculations of the consequences of both first and second dredge-up, i.e., of standard convection during the RGB and AGB stages, over a wide range of stellar masses (0.8-9 M_solar) and metallicities (Z=0.02-0.0001). We demonstrate that the common low- and intermediate-mass stars are a prime source of ^13C, ^14N, and ^17O in the universe. The light elements (^3He, ^4He, ^7Li, ^9Be, ^10B, and ^11B) are discussed in a companion paper.},

abstract = {Extant chemical evolution models underestimate the galactic production of Sr, Y, and Zr as well as the solar system abundances of s-only isotopes with 90 \lt A \lt 130. To solve this problem, an additional (unknown) process has been invoked, the so-called light element primary process (LEPP). In this paper we investigate possible alternative solutions. Based on Full Network Stellar evolutionary calculations, we investigate the effects on the solar system s-only distribution induced by the inclusion of some commonly ignored physical processes (e.g., rotation) or by the variation of the treatment of convective overshoot, mass loss, and the efficiency of nuclear processes. Our main findings are (1) at the epoch of the formation of the solar system, our reference model produces supersolar abundances for the whole s-only distribution, even in the range 90 \lt A \lt 130, (2) within errors, the s-only distribution relative to 150Sm is flat, (3) the s-process contribution of the less massive AGB stars (M \lt 1.5 M ⊙ ) as well as of the more massive ones (M \gt 4.0 M ⊙ ) are negligible, (4) the inclusion of rotation implies a downward shift of the whole distribution with a higher efficiency for the heavy s-only isotopes, leading to a flatter s-only distribution, (5) different prescriptions on convection or mass loss produce nearly rigid shifts of the whole distribution. In summary, a variation of the standard paradigm of AGB nucleosynthesis would allow reconciliation of model predictions with solar system s-only abundances. Nonetheless, the LEPP cannot be definitely ruled out because of the uncertainties still affecting stellar and galactic chemical evolution models.},

abstract = {It is now widely accepted that globular cluster red giant branch (RGB) stars owe their strange abundance patterns to a combination of pollution from progenitor stars and in situ extra mixing. In this hybrid theory a first generation of stars imprints abundance patterns into the gas from which a second generation forms. The hybrid theory suggests that extra mixing is operating in both populations and we use the variation of [C/Fe] with luminosity to examine how efficient this mixing is. We investigate the observed RGBs of M3, M13, M92, M15, and NGC 5466 as a means to test a theory of thermohaline mixing. The second parameter pair M3 and M13 are of intermediate metallicity and our models are able to account for the evolution of carbon along the RGB in both clusters, although in order to fit the most carbon-depleted main-sequence stars in M13 we require a model whose initial [C/Fe] abundance leads to a carbon abundance lower than is observed. Furthermore, our results suggest that stars in M13 formed with some primary nitrogen (higher C+N+O than stars in M3). In the metal-poor regime only NGC 5466 can be tentatively explained by thermohaline mixing operating in multiple populations. We find thermohaline mixing unable to model the depletion of [C/Fe] with magnitude in M92 and M15. It appears as if extra mixing is occurring before the luminosity function bump in these clusters. To reconcile the data with the models would require first dredge-up to be deeper than found in extant models.},

abstract = {Most carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars are thought to result from past mass transfer of He-burning material from an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star to a low-mass companion star, which we now observe as a CEMP star. Because AGB stars of intermediate mass efficiently cycle carbon into nitrogen in their envelopes, the same evolution scenario predicts the existence of a population of nitrogen-enhanced metal-poor (NEMP) stars, with [N/Fe] > 1 and [N/C] > 0.5. Such NEMP stars are rare, although their occurrence depends on metallicity: they appear to be more common at [Fe/H] < - 2.8 by about a factor of 10 compared to less metal-poor stars. We analyse the observed sample of metal-poor stars with measurements of both carbon and nitrogen to derive firm constraints on the occurrence of NEMP stars as a function of metallicity. We compare these constraints to binary population synthesis calculations in which we vary the initial distributions of mass, mass ratio and binary orbital periods. We show that the observed paucity of NEMP stars at [Fe/H] > - 2.8 does not allow for large modifications in the initial mass function, as have been suggested in the literature to account for the high frequency of CEMP stars. The situation at lower metallicity is less clear, and we do not currently have stellar models to perform this comparison for [Fe/H] < -2.8. However, unless intermediate-mass AGB stars behave very differently at such low metallicity, the observed NEMP frequency at [Fe/H] < -2.8 appears incompatible with the top-heavy forms of the initial mass function suggested in the literature.

The resolved H$\alpha$ line has a P Cygni-type profile, clearly demonstrating the presence of a dense, slow-moving ({\textasciitilde}100 km s-1) outflow. We have additionally found a huge near-infrared excess, hitherto unseen in Type Ia supernovae. We argue that this is due to an infrared light-echo arising from the pre-existing dusty circumstellar medium. We deduce a circumstellar medium mass probably exceeding 0.3 Msolar produced by a mass-loss rate greater than several times 10-4 Msolar yr-1. For the progenitor, we favour a single-degenerate system where the companion is a post-asymptotic giant branch star. As a by-product of our optical data, we are able to provide a firm identification of the host galaxy of SN 2002ic.},

abstract = {Slow neutron captures at A >{\textasciitilde} 85 are mainly guaranteed by the reaction 13C($\alpha$,n)16O in asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, requiring proton injections from the envelope. These were so far assumed to involve a small mass (lsim 10{\textendash}3 M {\&}{\#}9737;), but models with rotation suggest that in such tiny layers excessive 14N hampers s-processing. Furthermore, s-element abundances in galaxies require 13C-rich layers substantially extended in mass (gsim 4 {\texttimes} 10{\textendash}3 M {\&}{\#}9737;). We therefore present new calculations aimed at clarifying those issues and at understanding whether the solar composition helps to constrain the 13C "pocket" extension. We show that: (1) mixing "from bottom to top" (as in magnetic buoyancy or other forced mechanisms) can form a 13C reservoir substantially larger than assumed so far, covering most of the He-rich layers; (2) on the basis of this idea, stellar models at a fixed metallicity reproduce the main s-component as accurately as before; and (3) they make nuclear contributions from unknown nucleosynthesis processes (LEPP) unnecessary, against common assumptions. These models also avoid problems of mixing at the envelope border and fulfil requirements from C-star luminosities. They yield a large production of nuclei below A = 100, so that 86, 87Sr may be fully synthesized by AGB stars, while 88Sr, 89Y, and 94Zr are contributed more efficiently than before. Finally, we suggest tests suitable for providing a final answer regarding the extension of the 13C pocket.},

It is shown that these nebulae show abundance gradients (with galactocentric distance), which in the case of neon, argon, sulfur and oxygen (with four exceptions) are the same as HII regions and early type star abundance gradients. The abundance of these elements predicted from these gradients at the distance of the Sun from the center are exactly the solar abundance. Sulfur is the exception to this; the reason for this is discussed. The higher solar neon abundance is confirmed; this is discussed in terms of the results of helioseismology. Evidence is presented for oxygen destruction via ON cycling having occurred in the progenitors of four planetary nebulae with bilobal structure. These progenitor stars had a high mass, probably greater than 5 M{\&}sun;. This is deduced from the high values of He/H and N/H found in these nebulae. Formation of nitrogen, helium and carbon are discussed. The high mass progenitors which showed oxygen destruction are shown to have probably destroyed carbon as well. This is probably the result of hot bottom burning.},

abstract = {Hot subdwarfs represent a group of low-mass helium-burning stars formed through binary-star interactions and include some of the most chemically peculiar stars in the Galaxy. Stellar evolution theory suggests that they should have helium-rich atmospheres but, because radiation causes hydrogen to diffuse upwards, a majority are extremely helium poor. Questions posed include: when does the atmosphere become chemically stratified and at what rate? The existence of several helium-rich subdwarfs suggests further questions: are there distinct subgroups of hot subdwarf, or do hot subdwarfs change their surface composition in the course of evolution? Recent analyses have revealed remarkable surface chemistries amongst the helium-rich subgroup. In this paper, we analyse high-resolution spectra of nine intermediate helium-rich hot subdwarfs. We report the discovery that two stars, HE 2359-2844 and HE 1256-2738, show an atmospheric abundance of lead which is nearly 10 000 times that seen in the Sun. This is measured from optical Pb IV absorption lines never previously seen in any star. The lead abundance is 10 to 100 times that measured in normal hot-subdwarf atmospheres from ultraviolet spectroscopy. HE 2359-2844 also shows zirconium and yttrium abundances similar to those in the zirconium star LS IV-14{\textdegree}116. The new discoveries are interpreted in terms of heavily stratified atmospheres and the general picture of a surface chemistry in transition from a new-born helium-rich subdwarf to a normal helium-poor subdwarf.},

abstract = {Certain carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars likely obtained their composition via pollution from some of the earliest generations of asymptotic giant branch stars and as such provide important clues to early Universe nucleosynthesis. Recently, Kinman et al. discovered that the highly carbon- and barium-enriched metal-poor star SDSS J1707+58 is in fact an RR Lyrae pulsator. This gives us an object in a definite evolutionary state where the effects of dilution of material during the main sequence are minimized owing to the object having passed through first dredge-up. We perform detailed stellar modelling of putative progenitor systems in which we accreted material from asymptotic giant branch stars in the mass range 1-2 M⊙. We investigate how the surface abundances are affected by the inclusion of mechanisms like thermohaline mixing and gravitational settling. While we are able to find a reasonable fit to the carbon and sodium abundances of SDSS J1707+58, suggesting accretion of around 0.1 M⊙ from a 2 M⊙ companion, the strontium and barium abundances remain problematic and this object may have experienced something other than a standard s-process. We have more success in fitting the abundances of the mildly carbon-enriched, metal-poor RR Lyrae pulsator TY Gru (CS 22881-071), which we suggest received 0.1 M⊙ of material from a companion of around 1 M⊙.},

abstract = {Context. Extremely metal-poor (EMP), low-mass stars experience an ingestion of protons into the helium-rich layer during the core He-flash, resulting in the production of neutrons through the reactions 12C(p,$\gamma$)13N($\beta$)13C($\alpha$,n)16O. This is a potential site for the production of s-process elements in EMP stars, which does not occur in more metal-rich counterparts. The signatures of s-process elements in the two most iron deficient stars observed to date, HE1327-2326 {\&} HE0107-5240, still await for an explanation. Aims: We investigate the possibility that low-mass EMP stars could be the source of s-process elements observed in extremely iron deficient stars, either as a result of self-enrichment or in a binary scenario as the consequence of a mass transfer episode. Methods: We present evolutionary and post-processing s-process calculations of a 1 M⊙ stellar model with metallicities of Z = 0, 10-8, and 10-7. We assess the sensitivity of nucleosynthesis results to uncertainties in the input physics of the stellar models with particular regard to the details of convective mixing during the core He-flash. Results: Our models provide the possibility of explaining the C, O, Sr, and Ba abundance for the star HE0107-5240 as the result of mass-transfer from a low-mass EMP star. The drawback of our model is that nitrogen would be overproduced and the 12C/^{13C} abundance ratio would be underproduced in comparison to the observed values if mass would be transferred before the primary star enters the asymptotic giant branch phase. Conclusions: Our results show that low-mass EMP stars cannot be ruled out as companion stars that might have polluted HE1327-2326 and HE0107-5240 and produced the observed s-process pattern. However, more detailed studies of the core He-flash and the proton ingestion episode are needed to determine the robustness of our predictions.},

abstract = {Scenarios that invoke multiple episodes of star formation within young globular clusters (GCs) to explain the observed chemical and photometric anomalies in GCs require that clusters can retain the stellar ejecta of the stars within them and accrete large amounts of gas from their surroundings. Hence, it should be possible to find young massive clusters in the local Universe that contain significant amounts (>10 per cent) of the cluster mass of gas and/or dust within them. Recent theoretical studies have suggested that clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) with masses in excess of 104 M⊙ and ages between 30 and {\~{ }}300 Myr should contain such gas reservoirs. We have searched for H I gas within 12 LMC (and 1 Small Magellanic Cloud) clusters and also for dust using Spitzer 70 and 160 $\mu$m images. No clusters were found to contain gas and/or dust. While two of the clusters have H I at the same (projected) position and velocity, the gas does not appear to be centred on the clusters, but rather part of nearby clouds or filaments, suggesting that the gas and cluster are not directly related. This lack of gas (<1 per cent of the stellar mass) is in strong tension with model predictions, and may be due to higher stellar feedback than has been previously assumed or due to the assumptions used in the previous calculations.},

abstract = {High-resolution spectroscopic observations of 100 metal-poor carbon and s-rich stars (CEMP-s) collected from the literature are compared with the theoretical nucleosynthesis models of the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) presented in Paper I (MAGBini= 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 2 M⊙, - 3.6 ≲ [ Fe/H ] ≲- 1.5). The s-process enhancement detected in these objects is associated with binary systems: the more massive companion evolved faster through the thermally pulsing AGB phase (TP-AGB), synthesizing s-elements in the inner He intershell, which are partly dredged up to the surface during the third dredge-up (TDU) episode. The secondary observed low-mass companion became CEMP-s by the mass transfer of C- and s-rich material from the primary AGB. We analyse the light elements C, N, O, Na and Mg, as well as the two s-process indicators, [hs/ls] (where ls =<Y, Zr> is the the light-s peak at N = 50 and hs =<La, Nd, Sm> the heavy-s peak at N = 82) and [Pb/hs]. We distinguish between CEMP-s with high s-process enhancement, [hs/Fe] >rsim 1.5 (CEMP-sII), and mild s-process enhanced stars, [hs/Fe] < 1.5 (CEMP-sI). To interpret the observations, a range of s-process efficiencies at any given metallicity is necessary. This is confirmed by the high spread observed in [Pb/hs] ({\~{ }}2 dex). A degeneration of solutions is found with some exceptions: most main-sequence CEMP-sII stars with low [Na/Fe] can only be interpreted with MAGBini= 1.3-1.4 M⊙. Giants having suffered the first dredge-up (FDU) need a dilution >rsim1 dex (dil is defined as the mass of the convective envelope of the observed star, Mobs, over the material transferred from the AGB to the companion, MtransAGB). Then AGB models with higher AGB initial masses (MAGBini= 1.5-2 M⊙) are adopted to interpret CEMP-sII giants. In general, solutions with AGB models in the mass range MAGBini= 1.3-2 M⊙ and different dilution factors are found for CEMP-sI stars. About half of the CEMP-s stars with europium measurements show a high r-process enhancement (CEMP-s/r). The scenario for the origin of CEMP-s/r stars is a debated issue. We propose that the molecular cloud from which the binary system formed was previously enriched in r-process elements, most likely by local SN II pollution. This initial r-enrichment does not affect the s-process nucleosynthesis. However, for a high r-process enrichment ([r/Fe]ini= 2) the r-process contributions to solar La, Nd and Sm (30, 40 and 70 per cent) have to be considered. This increases the maximum [hs/ls] up to {\~{ }}0.3 dex. CEMP-s/r stars reflect this behaviour, showing higher [hs/ls] than observed in CEMP-s on average. Detailed analyses for individual stars will be provided in Paper III.},

abstract = {We present spectra of six metal-poor stars in two of the ultra-faint dwarf galaxies orbiting the Milky Way (MW), Ursa Major II, and Coma Berenices obtained with the Keck/High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer (HIRES). These observations include the first high-resolution spectroscopic observations of extremely metal-poor ([Fe/H] < -3.0) stars not belonging to the MW halo field star population. We obtain abundance measurements and upper limits for 26 elements between carbon and europium. The entire sample of stars spans a range of -3.2 < [Fe/H] < -2.3, and we confirm that each galaxy contains a large intrinsic spread of Fe abundances. A comparison with MW halo stars of similar metallicities reveals substantial agreement between the abundance patterns of the ultra-faint dwarf galaxies and the MW halo for the light, $\alpha$, and iron-peak elements (C to Zn). This agreement contrasts with the results of earlier studies of more metal-rich stars (-2.5 lsim [Fe/H] lsim -1.0) in more luminous dwarf spheroidal galaxies, which found significant abundance discrepancies with respect to the MW halo data. The abundances of neutron-capture elements (Sr to Eu) in the ultra-faint dwarf galaxies are extremely low, consistent with the most metal-poor halo stars, but not with the typical halo abundance pattern at [Fe/H] gsim -3.0. Not only are our results broadly consistent with a galaxy formation model that predicts that massive dwarf galaxies are the source of the metal-rich component ([Fe/H]> - 2.5) of the MW halo, but they also suggest that the faintest known dwarfs may be the primary contributors to the metal-poor end of the MW halo metallicity distribution.

abstract = {The presence of multiple populations is now well established in most globular clusters in the Milky Way. In light of this, here we propose a new model to explain the origin of the Sandage period-shift and the difference in mean period of type ab RR Lyrae variables between the two Oosterhoff groups. In our model, the instability strip in the metal-poor group II clusters, such as M15, is populated by second-generation stars (G2) with enhanced helium and CNO abundances, while the RR Lyraes in the relatively metal-rich group I clusters such as M3 are produced mostly by first-generation stars (G1) without these enhancements. This population shift within the instability strip with metallicity can create the observed period-shift between the two groups, as both helium and CNO abundances play a role in increasing the period of RR Lyraes. The presence of more metal-rich clusters having Oosterhoff-intermediate characteristics, such as NGC 1851, as well as of most metal-rich clusters having RR Lyraes with the longest periods (group III) can also be reproduced, as more helium-rich third and later generations of stars (G3) penetrate into the instability strip with a further increase in metallicity. Therefore, although there are systems in which the suggested population shift cannot be a viable explanation, for the most general cases our models predict that the RR Lyraes are produced mostly by G1, G2 and G3 for the Oosterhoff groups I, II and III, respectively.},

abstract = {We describe the interplay between stellar evolution and dynamical mass loss of evolving star clusters, based on the principles of stellar evolution and cluster dynamics and on the details of a grid of N-body simulations of Galactic cluster models. The cluster models have different initial masses, different orbits, including elliptical ones, and different initial density profiles. We use two sets of cluster models: one set of Roche lobe filling models and a new set of cluster models that are initially underfilling their tidal radius. We identify four distinct mass-loss effects: (1) mass loss by stellar evolution, (2) loss of stars induced by stellar evolution and (3) relaxation-driven mass loss before and (4) after core collapse. At young ages the mass loss is dominated by stellar evolution, followed by the evolution-induced loss of stars. This evolution-induced mass loss is important if a cluster is immersed in the tidal field. Both the evolution-induced loss of stars and the relaxation-driven mass loss need time to build up. This is described by a delay function that has a characteristic time-scale of a few crossing times for Roche lobe filling clusters and a few half-mass relaxation times for initially Roche lobe underfilling clusters. The relaxation-driven mass loss (called `dissolution' in this paper) can be described by a simple power-law dependence of the mass d(M/Msolar)/dt = -(M/Msolar)1 - $\gamma$/t0, where t0 depends on the orbit and environment of the cluster. The index $\gamma$ is 0.65 for clusters with a King parameter W0 = 5 for the initial density distribution, and 0.80 for more concentrated clusters with W0 = 7. For initially Roche lobe underfilling clusters the dissolution is described by the same $\gamma$ = 0.80, independent of the initial density distribution. The values of the constant t0 are derived for the models and described by simple formulae that depend on the orbit of the cluster. The mass-loss rate increases by about a factor of 2 at core collapse and the mass dependence of the relaxation-driven mass loss changes to $\gamma$ = 0.70 after core collapse. We also present a simple recipe for predicting the mass evolution of individual star clusters with various metallicities and in different environments, with an accuracy of a few per cent in most cases. This can be used to predict the mass evolution of cluster systems.},

abstract = {The study of photoionized environments is fundamental to many astrophysical problems. Up to the present most photoionization codes have numerically solved the equations of radiative transfer by making the extreme simplifying assumption of spherical symmetry. Unfortunately very few real astronomical nebulae satisfy this requirement. To remedy these shortcomings, a self-consistent, three-dimensional radiative transfer code has been developed using Monte Carlo techniques. The code, MOCASSIN, is designed to build realistic models of photoionized nebulae having arbitrary geometry and density distributions, with both the stellar and diffuse radiation fields treated self-consistently. In addition, the code is capable of treating one or more exciting stars located at non-central locations. The gaseous region is approximated by a cuboidal Cartesian grid composed of numerous cells. The physical conditions within each grid cell are determined by solving the thermal equilibrium and ionization balance equations. This requires a knowledge of the local primary and secondary radiation fields, which are calculated self-consistently by locally simulating the individual processes of ionization and recombination. The structure and the computational methods used in the MOCASSIN code are described in this paper. MOCASSIN has been benchmarked against established one-dimensional spherically symmetric codes for a number of standard cases, as defined by the Lexington/Meudon photoionization workshops: at Meudon in 1985 and at Lexington in 1995 and 2000. The results obtained for the benchmark cases are satisfactory and are presented in this paper. A performance analysis has also been carried out and is discussed here.},

abstract = {The initial-to final mass relation is revised in view of new theoretical and observational data. Recent stellar evolution models predict core masses at the beginning of the thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch which practically coincide with final white dwarf masses derived for NGC 3532 and the binary white dwarf PG 0922+162. The Hyades white dwarfs must be relocated at higher initial masses since Hipparcos data lead to a reduced cluster age, and move also closer to the first TP relation. Comparison with theoretically predicted initial to final mass relations support the new evolutionary models with exponential diffusive overshoot which undergo core mass reduction by a strong third dredge-up. The upper mass limit for C/O white dwarf production is smaller than hitherto assumed, around 6.5 Msun with white dwarf masses below 1 Msun. More massive white dwarfs must have Ne/O cores after off-center carbon burning or are due to mergers or rotational lifting. Differential mass loss seems to be small thus justifying the use of an universal Mi/Mf relation for calculations of stellar and galactic evolution. It differs from the widely used 1987 relation and is steeper especially in the mass range from 3 to 4 Msun},

abstract = {The FOCAP multi-object fibre optic system on the AAT has been used to obtain spectra for a sample of more than a hundred faint stars in the globular cluster 47 Tuc (NGC 104), from the base of the giant branch to about a magnitude below the main-sequence turn-off. The spectra cover the ultraviolet and blue bands of CN and the G band of CH. Quantitative abundances have been derived by comparing the observations with synthetic spectra. The main-sequence stars can be divided into two approximately equal groups, one having N enhanced by a factor of {\textasciitilde}7, and C depleted by 40 per cent, relative to the other, similar to what is inferred for the red giants. The mean heavy-element abundance, as measured by Ca or Fe, differs between the two groups by no more than 0.01+/-0.05 dex. All the available abundance data indicate that the atmospheres of 47 Tuc stars contain different amounts of material which has been processed through the CNO cycle, but not through more advanced stages of nucleosynthesis. In the red giants, this could be a result of the convective dredge-up of processed material from deep within the stars themselves, as occurs in some more metal-poor clusters. However, stars on the upper main sequence of globular clusters do not have convective envelopes, while any deep mixing there would have consequences incompatible with other observational data. Thus it seems that the main-sequence C and N variations must be either primordial or caused by a pollution mechanism. The similarity of the bimodal abundance patterns among the dwarfs and giants then suggests that the dredge up of CNO-cycled material is not the dominant process in the red giants either, at least not in 47 Tuc. The CNO-processed material seems most likely to have come from intermediate-mass stars on the asymptotic giant branch; various mechanisms by which such material might appear in the main-sequence stars are discussed. Explanations involving a truly primordial origin, or having successive generations of stars, seem to require rather special `tuning'. A somewhat speculative alternative self-enrichment process is proposed, in which stellar winds from intermediate-mass stars were captured by existing low-mass stars, early in the life of the cluster. Whatever the mechanism, the abundance data presumably contain important clues about the formation and early evolution of globular clusters.},

We detect an intrinsic star-to-star spread in the potassium abundance. Moreover [K/Fe] abundance ratios display statistically significant correlations with [Na/Fe] and [Al/Fe], and anti-correlations with [O/Fe] and [Mg/Fe]. All the four Mg deficient stars ([Mg/Fe] < 0.0) discovered so far in NGC 2808 are enriched in K by {\textasciitilde}0.3 dex with respect to those with normal [Mg/Fe]. NGC 2808 is the second globular cluster, after NGC 2419, where a clear Mg-K anti-correlation is detected, albeit of weaker amplitude. The simultaneous correlation/anti-correlation of [K/Fe] with all the light elements usually involved in the chemical anomalies observed in globular cluster stars strongly support the idea that these abundance patterns are due to the same self-enrichment mechanism that produces Na-O and Mg-Al anti-correlations. This finding suggests that detectable spreads in K abundances may be typical in the massive globular clusters where the self-enrichment processes are observed to produce their most extreme manifestations.

abstract = {High-velocity outflows from supermassive black holes have been invoked to explain the recent identification of strong absorption features in the hard X-ray spectra of several quasars. Here, Monte Carlo radiative transfer calculations are performed to synthesize X-ray spectra from models of such flows. It is found that simple, parametric biconical outflow models with plausible choices for the wind parameters predict spectra that are in good qualitative agreement with observations in the 2-10 keV band. The influence on the spectrum of both the mass-loss rate and opening angle of the flow are considered: the latter is important since photon leakage plays a significant role in establishing an ionization gradient within the flow, a useful discriminant between spherical and conical outflow for this and other applications. Particular attention is given to the bright quasar PG 1211+143 for which constraints on the outflow geometry and mass-loss rate are discussed subject to the limitations of the currently available observational data.},

abstract = {This is the fourth paper in a series aimed at finding high-redshift quasars from five-color (u'g'r'i'z') imaging data taken along the celestial equator by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey during its commissioning phase. In this paper, we use the color-selected sample of 39 luminous high-redshift quasars presented in Paper III to derive the evolution of the quasar luminosity function over the range 3.6<z<5.0 and -27.5<M1450<-25.5 ($\Omega$=1, H0=50 km s-1 Mpc-1). We use the selection function derived in Paper III to correct for sample incompleteness. The luminosity function is estimated using three different methods: (1) the 1/Va estimator; (2) a maximum likelihood solution, assuming that the density of quasars depends exponentially on redshift and as a power law in luminosity; and (3) Lynden-Bell's nonparametric C- estimator. All three methods yield consistent results. The luminous quasar density decreases by a factor of {\textasciitilde}6 from z=3.5 to z=5.0, consistent with the decline seen from several previous optical surveys at z<4.5. The luminosity function follows $\psi$(L){\textasciitilde}L-2.5 for z{\textasciitilde}4 at the bright end, significantly flatter than the bright-end luminosity function $\psi$(L){\textasciitilde}L-3.5 found in previous studies for z<3, suggesting that the shape of the quasar luminosity function evolves with redshift as well, and that the quasar evolution from z=2 to z=5 cannot be described as pure luminosity evolution. Possible selection biases and the effect of dust extinction on the redshift evolution of the quasar density are also discussed. Based on observations obtained with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, with the Apache Point Observatory 3.5 m telescope, which is owned and operated by the Astrophysical Research Consortium, by the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California, and NASA, and was made possible by the generous financial support of the W.

abstract = {In this contribution, a review is presented on the ample data obtained on post-AGB stars, both on the central stars and their circumstellar material. The fast evolutionary phase is characterized by a rapid change in the properties of the objects, but the variety is so large that there is yet no clear consensus on how the detailed studies of individual objects are linked together by evolutionary channels. The absence of strong molecular veiling in the photospheres of the central stars, together with a spread in intrinsic metallicity make post-AGB stars very useful in constraining AGB chemical evolutionary models. We discuss the surprisingly wide variety of chemical signatures observed. The onset in the creation process of the panoply of structures and shapes observed in planetary nebulae occurs during the short post-AGB evolution, but the physical nature of the processes involved is still badly understood. In the rapidly growing field of circumstellar mineralogy, post-AGB stars have their story to tell and also the molecular envelope changes significantly due to dilution and hardening of the stellar radiation. The real-time evolution of some objects suffering a late thermal flash is reviewed and their possible link to other hydrogen-deficient objects is discussed. Any review on stellar evolution has a section on binaries and this contribution is no exception because binaries make up a significant fraction of the post-AGB stars known to date.},

In order to facilitate this research further, the Joint Institute for Nuclear Astrophysics (JINA) has created a public, web-based database for thermonuclear reaction rates. Data are stored in the standard Reaclib format and are continually updated as new data or new compilations become available. A versioning system has been adopted to keep track of new rates. Recommended rate libraries representing ``snap shots'' of the live database are stored for users wanting a fixed/unchanging set of rates.

abstract = {{We present the results of extensive evolutionary computations from the Zero Age Main Sequence to the Red Giants, for stars in the range 0.6 /15 M_sun and with chemistry (Y, Z) = (0.274, 0.017). The novelty of these computations is in the general treatment of convection, namely: 1. convection as a whole is addressed in the Full Spectrum of Turbulence model (billions of eddy scales are considered) with the appropriate convective fluxes distribution, as opposed to the one-eddy Mixing Length Theory; 2. local chemical evolution also in the presence of convection is separately evaluated for each element, as a result of a process in which nuclear evolution and turbulent transport are fully coupled by means of a diffusive scheme (coupled-diffusion); 3. convective overshooting (when considered) is also addressed in the above coupled-diffusive scheme, assuming that the turbulent velocity exponentially vanishes outside the formally convective region according to an e-folding free parameter zeta , tuned to fit observations. After some tests on the small solar convective core in early main sequence, we discuss the effects of coupled-diffusion in the cores of larger mass stars, where the nuclear lifetimes of some (p-p and) CNO elements can be comparable to the mixing times. We also compute a full grid of tracks with a small amount of overshooting, finding that a unique free parameter can be suitable for the whole range of mass considered (solar and below solar included). Theoretical tracks are discussed, and isochrones are compared to the observational HR diagram for the Pleiades, finding an age > 120 Myr, consistent with that obtained from the candidate brown dwarf PPL 15. An age is also derived for the young cluster alpha Persei, for which a datation from the detection of lithium in brown dwarf candidates should be soon available. For completeness, and to facilitate comparisons with results by other authors, we also describe in details the ATON 2.0 code used for the present computations.}},

abstract = {Context. Stellar population studies of globular clusters have suggested that the brightest clusters in the Galaxy might actually be the remnant nuclei of dwarf spheroidal galaxies. If the present Galactic globular clusters formed within larger stellar systems, they are likely to be surrounded by extratidal halos and/or tails made up of stars that were tidally stripped from their parent systems. Aims: The stellar surroundings around globular clusters are therefore one of the best places to look for the remnants of an ancient dwarf galaxy. Here an attempt is made to search for tidal debris around the supernovae enriched globular clusters M 22 and NGC 1851, as well as the kinematically unique cluster NGC 3201. Methods: The stellar parameters from the RAdial Velocity Experiment (RAVE) are used to identify stars with the RAVE metallicities, radial velocities, and elemental abundances that are consistent with the abundance patterns and properties of the stars in M 22, NGC 1851, and NGC 3201. Results: Discovery of RAVE stars that may be associated with M 22 and NGC 1851 are reported, some of which are at projected distances {\textasciitilde}10 degrees away from the core of these clusters. Numerous RAVE stars associated with NGC 3201 suggest that either the tidal radius of this cluster is underestimated or that there are some unbound stars extending a few arc minutes from the edge of the cluster's radius. No other extratidal stars associated with NGC 3201 could be identified. The bright magnitudes of the RAVE stars make them easy targets for high-resolution follow-up observations, eventually allowing further chemical tagging to solidify (or exclude) stars outside the tidal radius of the cluster as tidal debris. In both our radial velocity histograms of the regions surrounding NGC 1851 and NGC 3201, a peak of stars at {\textasciitilde}230 km s-1 is seen, consistent with extended tidal debris from $\omega$ Centauri.},

abstract = {Standard analytical chemical evolution modelling of galaxies has been assuming the stellar initial mass function (IMF) to be invariant and fully sampled allowing fractions of massive stars to contribute even in dwarf galaxies with very low star formation rates (SFRs). Recent observations show the integrated galactic initial mass function (IGIMF) of stars, i.e. the galaxy-wide IMF, to become systematically top-heavy with increasing SFR. This has been predicted by the IGIMF theory, which is here used to develop the analytical theory of the chemical evolution of galaxies. This theory is non-linear and requires the iterative solution of implicit integral equations due to the dependence of the IGIMF on the metallicity and on the SFR. It is shown that the mass-metallicity relation of galaxies emerges naturally, although at low masses the theoretical predictions overestimate the observations by 0.3--0.4 dex. A good agreement with the observation can be obtained only if gas flows are taken into account. In particular, we are able to reproduce the mass--metallicity relation observed by Lee et al. (2006) with modest amounts of infall and with an outflow rate which decreases as a function of the galactic mass. The outflow rates required to fit the data are considerably smaller than required in models with invariant IMFs.},

abstract = {The blue Main Sequence (bMS) of $\omega$ Cen implies a ratio of helium to metal enrichment $\Delta$ Y/$\Delta$ Z $\approx$ 70, which is a major enigma. We show that rotating models of low metallicity stars, which account for the anomalous abundance ratios of extremely metal poor stars, are also useful for understanding the very high $\Delta$ Y/$\Delta$ Z ratio in $\omega$ Cen. Models of massive stars with moderate initial rotation velocities produce stellar winds with large He- and N-excesses, but without the large C- (and O-) excesses made by very fast rotation, in agreement with the observed chemical abundance ratios in $\omega$ Cen. It is still uncertain whether the abundance peculiarities of $\omega$ Cen result from the fact that the high velocity contributions of supernovae escaped the globular cluster, usually considered as a tidally stripped core of a dwarf galaxy. Another possibility is a general dominance of wind ejecta at very low Z, due to the formation of black holes. Some abundance and isotopic ratios like Mg/Al, Na/Mg, Ne/N, 12C/13C, 16O/18O and 17O/18O may allow us to further discriminate between these scenarios and between the AGB and massive star contributions.},

abstract = {About half of the stable nuclei heavier than iron are believed to be synthesized during the late stages of evolution of stars with masses in the range 0.8-8 solar masses. These elements are then expelled into the interstellar medium through stellar winds after being `dredged up' towards the surface of the stars. These processes occur when the star is in the `asymptotic giant branch' (AGB) phase of its life. Nuclei (mainly iron) deep inside the star slowly capture neutrons and progressively build up heavier elements (the `s-process'). For AGB stars that formed early in the history of the Galaxy, and that therefore have very low abundances of elements heavier than helium (`metals'), models predict that the s-process will accumulate synthesized material with atomic weights in the Pb-Bi region. Such stars will therefore have large overabundances of lead relative to other heavy elements. Here we report the discovery of large amounts of lead in three metal-poor stars (HD187861, HD196944 and HD224959). Our analysis shows that these stars are more enriched in lead than in any other element heavier than iron. The excellent agreement between the observed and predicted abundances reinforces our current understanding of the detailed operation of the s-process deep in the interiors of AGB stars.},

abstract = {We examine the effects of thermohaline mixing on the composition of the envelopes of low-metallicity asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. We have evolved models of 1, 1.5 and 2Msolar from the pre-main sequence to the end of the thermally pulsing AGB with thermohaline mixing applied throughout the simulations. In agreement with other authors, we find that thermohaline mixing substantially reduces the abundance of 3He on the upper part of the red giant branch in our lowest mass model. However, the small amount of 3He that remains is enough to drive thermohaline mixing on the AGB. We find that thermohaline mixing is most efficient in the early thermal pulses and its efficiency drops from pulse to pulse. Nitrogen is not substantially affected by the process, but we do see substantial changes in 13C. The 12C/13C ratio is substantially lowered during the early thermal pulses, but the efficacy of the process is seen to diminish rapidly. As the process stops after a few pulses, the 12C/13C ratio is still able to reach values of 103- 104, which is inconsistent with the values measured in carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars. We also note a surprising increase in the 7Li abundance, with reaching values of over 2.5 in the 1.5Msolar model. It is thus possible to get stars which are both C and Li rich at the same time. We compare our models to measurements of carbon and lithium in carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars which have not yet reached the giant branch. These models can simultaneously reproduce the observed C and Li abundances of carbon-enhanced metal-poor turn-off stars that are Li rich, but the observed nitrogen abundances still cannot be matched.},

abstract = {Approximately 25%-30% of pulsating asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars show long secondary periods (LSPs) of typical length {\textasciitilde}400-1500 days, roughly 10 times longer than the primary period of pulsation. Here we seek an explanation for the LSPs. We describe the spectral variations over a 4 yr interval for three of these stars. The radial velocity is found to vary during the LSP with full amplitude of {\textasciitilde}5 km s-1, a result similar to that found by Hinkle and coworkers for six other variables of this type. Variations in the H$\alpha$ and Na D line profiles throughout the LSP suggest that chromospheric activity and mass loss vary with the period of the LSP. Possible explanations for the photometric and radial velocity variations include eccentric motion of an orbiting companion of mass {\textasciitilde}0.1 Msolar, radial and nonradial pulsation, rotation of an ellipsoidal-shaped red giant, episodic dust ejection, and star spot cycles. We discuss each of these models and show that they all have problems. The most likely explanation is that the LSPs result from a low degree g+ mode confined to the outer radiative layers of the red giant, combined with large-scale star spot activity to give the observed chromosphere and the irregularity of the light curve. We suggest that these stars may be the precursors of asymmetric planetary nebulae.},

abstract = {We examine the growing class of binary millisecond pulsars known as redbacks. In these systems, the pulsar's companion has a mass between 0.1 and about 0.5 M⊙ in an orbital period of less than 1.5 d. All show extended radio eclipses associated with circumbinary material. They do not lie on the period-companion mass relation expected from the canonical intermediate-mass X-ray binary evolution in which the companion filled its Roche lobe as a red giant and has now lost its envelope and cooled as a white dwarf. The redbacks lie closer to, but usually at higher period than, the period-companion mass relation followed by cataclysmic variables and low-mass X-ray binaries. In order to turn on as a pulsar mass accretion on to a neutron star must be sufficiently weak, considerably weaker than expected in systems with low-mass main-sequence companions driven together by magnetic braking or gravitational radiation. If a neutron star is formed by accretion-induced collapse of a white dwarf as it approaches the Chandrasekhar limit some baryonic mass is abruptly lost to its binding energy so that its effective gravitational mass falls. We propose that redbacks form when accretion-induced collapse of a white dwarf takes place during cataclysmic variable binary evolution because the loss of gravitational mass makes the orbit expand suddenly so that the companion no longer fills its Roche lobe. Once activated, the pulsar can ablate its companion and so further expand the orbit and also account for the extended eclipses in the radio emission of the pulsar that are characteristic of these systems. The whole period-companion mass space occupied by the redbacks can be populated in this way.},

abstract = {Growing interests in neutron star (NS) mergers as the origin of r-process elements have sprouted since the discovery of evidence for the ejection of these elements from a short-duration $\gamma$-ray burst. The hypothesis of a NS merger origin is reinforced by a theoretical update of nucleosynthesis in NS mergers successful in yielding r-process nuclides with A > 130. On the other hand, whether the origin of light r-process elements are associated with nucleosynthesis in NS merger events remains unclear. We find a signature of nucleosynthesis in NS mergers from peculiar chemical abundances of stars belonging to the Galactic globular cluster M15. This finding combined with the recent nucleosynthesis results implies a potential diversity of nucleosynthesis in NS mergers. Based on these considerations, we are successful in the interpretation of an observed correlation between [light r-process/Eu] and [Eu/Fe] among Galactic halo stars and accordingly narrow down the role of supernova nucleosynthesis in the r-process production site. We conclude that the tight correlation by a large fraction of halo stars is attributable to the fact that core-collapse supernovae produce light r-process elements while heavy r-process elements such as Eu and Ba are produced by NS mergers. On the other hand, stars in the outlier, composed of r-enhanced stars ([Eu/Fe] gsim +1) such as CS22892-052, were exclusively enriched by matter ejected by a subclass of NS mergers that is inclined to be massive and consist of both light and heavy r-process nuclides.},

abstract = {A detailed numerical study was designed and conducted to estimate the absolute age and the uncertainty in age (with confidence limits) of the oldest globular clusters in our galaxy, and hence to put a robust lower bound on the age of the universe. Estimates of the uncertainty range and distribution in the input parameters of stellar evolution codes were used to produce 1000 Monte Carlo realizations of stellar isochrones, which were then used to derive ages for the 17 oldest globular clusters. A probability distribution for the mean age of these systems was derived by incorporating the observational uncertainties in the measured color-magnitude diagrams for these systems and the predicted isochrones. The dominant contribution to the width of the distribution (approximately {\textpm}5 percent) resulted from the observational uncertainty in RR-Lyrae variable absolute magnitudes. Subdominant contributions came from the choice of the color table used to translate theoretical luminosities and temperatures to observed magnitudes and colors, as well as from theoretical uncertainties in heavy element abundances and mixing length. The one-sided 95 percent confidence limit lower bound for this distribution occurs at an age of 12.07 x 10^9 years, and the median age for the distribution is 14.56 x 10^9 years. These age limits, when compared with the Hubble age estimate, put powerful constraints on cosmology.},

Two processes affecting the surface composition have been taken into account, namely: (1) convective dredge-ups, and (2) nuclear burning in the deepest layers of the convective envelope. Mass loss due to the stellar wind in the red-giant phase, and the envelope ejection leading to the formation of planetary nebulae have been also taken into account. In this way, several individual and collective properties of carbon stars are predicted, as well as the expected compositions of planetary nebulae, and the contribution of intermediate-mass stars to the galactic nucleosynthesis of the nuclides listed above. The primary production of C-13 and N-14 is also treated. A preliminary comparison with the observations shows that the present theory is able to account for several characteristics of carbon stars in the Galaxy, as well as in the Magellanic Clouds, and in the dwarf elliptical galaxy in Fornax. The theory accounts also for the observed range of helium abundances in planetary nebulae.},

abstract = {Context. The injection of hydrogen into the convection shell powered by helium burning during the core helium flash is commonly encountered during the evolution of metal-free and extremely metal-poor low-mass stars. Multidimensional hydrodynamic simulations indicate that the hydrogen injection may also occur in more metal-rich stars due to turbulent entrainment that accelerates the growth of the shell convection zone and increases its size. However, one-dimensional stellar models cast doubts that helium-flash hydrogen mixing does occur as it requires the crossing of an entropy barrier at the helium-hydrogen interface. Aims: With specifically designed multidimensional hydrodynamic simulations, we aim to prove that an entropy barrier is no obstacle to the growth of the helium-burning shell convection zone in the helium core of a metal-rich Population I star, i.e. convection can penetrate into the hydrogen-rich layers for these stars, too. We study whether this is also possible in one-dimensional stellar evolutionary calculations. Methods: We artificially shift the hydrogen-rich layer closer to the outer edge of the helium-burning shell convection zone in a Population I star with a mass of 1.25 M⊙, and simulate the subsequent evolution in two and three dimensions, respectively. We also perform stellar evolutionary calculations of the core helium flash in metal-rich stars implementing turbulent entrainment by means of a simple prescription. These simulations were performed with the Eulerian hydrodynamical code HERAKLES and the stellar evolution code STAREVOL, respectively. Results: Our hydrodynamical simulations show that the helium-burning shell convection zone in the helium core moves across the entropy barrier and reaches the hydrogen-rich layers. This leads to a mixing of protons into the hotter layers of the core and to a rapid increase in the nuclear energy production at the upper edge of the helium-burning convection shell - the hydrogen injection flash. As a result, a second convection zone appears in the hydrogen-rich layers. In contrast to one-dimensional models, the entropy barrier separating the two convective shells from each other is largely permeable to chemical transport when allowing for multidimensional flow and consequently hydrogen is continuously mixed deep into the helium core. We find it difficult to replicate this behavior using one-dimensional stellar evolutionary calculations.},

abstract = {Solar photospheric and meteoritic CI chondrite abundance determinations for all elements are summarized and the best currently available photospheric abundances are selected. The meteoritic and solar abundances of a few elements (e.g., noble gases, beryllium, boron, phosphorous, sulfur) are discussed in detail. The photospheric abundances give mass fractions of hydrogen (X=0.7491), helium (Y=0.2377), and heavy elements (Z=0.0133), leading to Z/X=0.0177, which is lower than the widely used Z/X=0.0245 from previous compilations. Recent results from standard solar models considering helium and heavy-element settling imply that photospheric abundances and mass fractions are not equal to protosolar abundances (representative of solar system abundances). Protosolar elemental and isotopic abundances are derived from photospheric abundances by considering settling effects. Derived protosolar mass fractions are X0=0.7110, Y0=0.2741, and Z0=0.0149. The solar system and photospheric abundance tables are used to compute self-consistent sets of condensation temperatures for all elements.},

We determined abundances for C+N+O, Na, $\alpha$, iron-peak, and s-elements. We found that the two RGB populations significantly differ in their light (N, O, Na) and s-element content. On the other hand, they do not show any significant difference in their $\alpha$ and iron-peak element content. More importantly, the two RGB populations do not show any significant difference in their total C+N+O content. Our results do not support previous hypotheses suggesting that the origins of the two RGBs and the two subgiant branches of the cluster are related to different content of either $\alpha$ (including Ca) or iron-peak elements, or C+N+O abundance, due to a second generation polluted by Type II supernovae.},

abstract = {We present CN and CH indices and Ca II triplet metallicities for 34 giant stars and chemical abundances for 33 elements in 14 giants in the globular cluster M2. Assuming that the programme stars are cluster members, our analysis reveals (i) an extreme variation in CN and CH line strengths, (ii) a metallicity dispersion with a dominant peak at [Fe/H] $\approx$ -1.7 and smaller peaks at -1.5 and -1.0, (iii) star-to-star abundance variations and correlations for the light elements O, Na, Al and Si and (iv) a large (and possibly bimodal) distribution in the abundances of all elements produced mainly via the s-process in Solar system material. Following Roederer, Marino {\&} Sneden, we define two groups of stars, `r + s' and `r-only', and subtract the average abundances of the latter from the former group to obtain an `s-process residual'. This s-process residual is remarkably similar to that found in M22 and in M4 despite the range in metallicity covered by these three systems. With recent studies identifying a double subgiant branch in M2 and a dispersion in Sr and Ba abundances, our spectroscopic analysis confirms that this globular cluster has experienced a complex formation history with similarities to M22, NGC 1851 and $\omega$ Centauri.},

abstract = {By means of chemo-photometric models for galaxies of different morphological types, we have carried out a detailed study of the history of element production by spheroidal and dwarf irregular galaxies. Spheroidal galaxies suffer a strong and intense star formation episode at early times. In dwarf irregulars, the star formation rate (SFR) proceeds at a low regime but continuously. Both galactic types enrich the intergalactic medium (IGM) with metals by means of galactic winds. We have assumed that the galaxy number density is fixed and normalized to the value of the optical luminosity function observed in the local Universe. Our models allow us to investigate in detail how the metal fractions locked up in stars in spheroids and dwarf irregulars, those present in the interstellar medium (ISM) and those ejected into the IGM have changed with cosmic time. By relaxing the instantaneous recycling approximation and taking into account stellar lifetimes, for the first time we have studied the evolution of the chemical abundance ratios in the IGM and compared our predictions with a set of observations by various authors. Our results indicate that the bulk of the IGM enrichment is due to spheroids, with dwarf irregular galaxies playing a negligible role. Our predictions grossly account for the [O/H] observed in the IGM at high redshift, but overestimate the [C/H]. Furthermore, it appears hard to reproduce the abundance ratios observed in the high-redshift IGM. Some possible explanations are discussed in the text. This is the first attempt to study the abundance ratios in the IGM by means of detailed chemical evolution models which take into account the stellar lifetimes. Numerical simulations adopting our chemical evolution prescriptions could be useful to improve our understanding of the IGM chemical enrichment.},

abstract = {To study the possible origin of the huge helium enrichment attributed to the stars on the blue main sequence of $\omega$Centauri, we make use of a chemical evolution model that has proven able to reproduce other major observed properties of the cluster, namely its stellar metallicity distribution function, age-metallicity relation and trends of several abundance ratios with metallicity. In this framework, the key condition to satisfy all the available observational constraints is that a galactic-scale outflow develops in a much more massive parent system, as a consequence of multiple supernova explosions in a shallow potential well. This galactic wind must carry out preferentially the metals produced by explosive nucleosynthesis in supernovae, whereas elements restored to the interstellar medium through low-energy stellar winds by both asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars and massive stars must be mostly retained. Assuming that helium is ejected through slow winds by both AGB stars and fast-rotating massive stars, the interstellar medium of $\omega$Centauri's parent galaxy gets naturally enriched in helium in the course of its evolution.},

abstract = {Stellar convection is customarily described by Mixing-Length Theory, which makes use of the mixing length-scale to express the convective flux, velocity, and temperature gradients of the convective elements and stellar medium. The mixing length-scale is taken to be proportional to the local pressure scaleheight, and the proportionality factor (the mixing-length parameter) must be determined by comparing the stellar models to some calibrator, usually the Sun. No strong arguments exist to suggest that the mixing-length parameter is the same in all stars and at all evolutionary phases. The aim of this study is to present a new theory of stellar convection that does not require the mixing-length parameter. We present a self-consistent analytical formulation of stellar convection that determines the properties of stellar convection as a function of the physical behaviour of the convective elements themselves and of the surrounding medium. This new theory is formulated starting from a conventional solution of the Navier-Stokes/Euler equations, i.e. the Bernoulli equation for a perfect fluid, but expressed in a non-inertial reference frame comoving with the convective elements. In our formalism, the motion of stellar convective cells inside convectively unstable layers is fully determined by a new system of equations for convection in a non-local and time-dependent formalism. We obtain an analytical, non-local, time-dependent subsonic solution for the convective energy transport that does not depend on any free parameter. The theory is suitable for the outer convective zones of solar type stars and stars of all mass on the main-sequence band. The predictions of the new theory are compared with those from the standard mixing-length paradigm for the most accurate calibrator, the Sun, with very satisfactory results.},

In the halo, the s-efficiency drops at low metallicities, with Fe/H below about -2. The elemental s-contributions from massive stars to the solar abundances from iron to zirconium are presented. It is concluded that the weak component can account for a consistent fraction of the solar Cu, Ga, Ge, and Se. The evolutionary trends of elements such as Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Rb, Sr, Y, and Zr are discussed in comparison with observations of stars belonging to the halo, where massive stars give their major imprint.},

abstract = {Results of a systematic survey of Al, Mg, and Eu abundances of stars near the tip of the giant branch in globular clusters and in the halo field are reported. Mg abundances were obtained independently from spectral synthesis of the 5136 {\AA} MgH features and from EW analysis of five Mg I features. A comparison of the two sets of Mg abundances shows good agreement. Within the errors, the field stars exhibit no star-to-star differences in 0, Mg, or Al at any [Fe/H] metallicity. Among the moderately (- 1.0> [Fe/H]> 1.9) and very metal-poor (-1.9>[Fe/H]> -3.0) halo field giants, [Na/Fe] is found to have star-to-star differences. The giants in the globular cluster M71 ([Fe/H] =-0.8) are also found to have star-to-star differences in Na but not in Mg, Al. It is concluded that either Al and Na are created in different nucleosynthetic processes, or the NeNa cycle of deep mixing can occur without the NO or MgAl cycles. Star-to-star differences in Al abundances for bright giants in M92 ([Fe/H]= -2.2), M13 ([Fe/H] - 1.5), and MS ([Fe/H] = -1.2) have been detected. The Al-Na correlation and the Al-O anti-correlation observed in these clusters are consistent with the predictions of the deep mixing theory (Langer {\&} Hoffman 1995). M13, which has the largest spread in Al, Na, and 0 abundances, has star-to-star differences in the Mg abundance that are anti-correlated with Al. The [Al/Mg] ratio is consistent with the hypothesis that Mg is being processed into Al. However, if only 25Mg and 26Mg are expected to be converted to 27Al, the implied ratios of these isotopes to 24Mg would he considerably larger than the measured Mg isotopic ratios in the few halo field giants which have been studied. The abundances, [Eu/Fe], of the r-process element Eu are found to be positive over the entire metallicity range. No correlations ($\chi$2v=0.64) between Eu and the deep mixing elements Al, Mg, O, and Na are found, ruling out a neutron-rich environment as the origin of the star-to-star abundance differences of these elements. The evidence presented here, when combined with results presented in the literature, imply that the star-to-star abundance differences observed among stars in the clusters M13, MS, and M92 are due to deep mixing of NeNa, MgAl, and CNO processed material from within the stars themselves.},

abstract = {We present a new set of stellar yields obtained from rotating stellar models at solar metallicity covering the massive star range (12-60 M{\&}sun;). The stellar models were calculated with the latest version of the Geneva stellar evolution code described in Hirschi et al. (2004). Evolution and nucleosynthesis are in general followed up to silicon burning. The yields of our non-rotating models are consistent with other calculations and differences can be understood in the light of the treatment of convection and the rate used for 12C($\alpha$,$\gamma$)16O. This verifies the accuracy of our calculations and gives a safe basis for studying the effects of rotation on the yields. The contributions from stellar winds and supernova explosions to the stellar yields are presented separately. We then add the two contributions to compute the total stellar yields. Below {\~{ }} 30 M{\&}sun;, rotation increases the total metal yields, Z, and in particular the yields of carbon and oxygen by a factor of 1.5-2.5. As a rule of thumb, the yields of a rotating 20 M{\&}sun; star are similar to the yields of a non-rotating 30 M{\&}sun; star, at least for the light elements considered in this work. For very massive stars ({\~{ }} 60 M{\&}sun;), rotation increases the yield of helium but does not significantly affect the yields of heavy elements.},

abstract = {Context: Massive AGB (hereafter super-AGB or SAGB) stars ignite carbon off-center and have initial masses ranging between Mup, the minimum initial mass for carbon ignition, and M_mas the minimum mass for the formation of an iron core collapse supernova. In this mass interval, stars more massive than Mn will undergo an electron capture supernova (EC-SN). Aims: We study the fate and selected evolutionary properties of SAGB stars up to the end of the carbon burning phase as a function of metallicity and core overshooting. Methods: The method is based on the analysis of a large set of stellar models covering the mass range 5-13 M{\&}sun; and calculated for 7 different metallicities between Z=10-5 and twice solar. Core overshooting was considered in two subsets for Z=10-4 and 0.02. The models are available online at http://www-astro.ulb.ac.be/ siess/database.html. The fate of SAGB stars is investigated through a parametric model which allows us to assess the role of mass loss and of the third dredge-up. Results: Our main results can be summarized as follows: a) prior to C-burning, the evolution of SAGB stars is very similar to that of intermediate-mass stars, being more luminous, b) SAGB stars suffer a large He enrichment at the end of the second dredge-up, c) the limiting masses Mup, Mn and M_mas present a nonlinear behavior with Z, characterized by a minimum around Z=10-4, d) the values of Mup, Mn and M_mas are decreased by 2 M{\&}sun; when core overshooting is considered, e) our models predict a minimum oxygen-neon white dwarf mass of 1.05 M{\&}sun;, f) the determination of Mn is highly dependent on the mass loss and core growth rates, g) the evolutionary channel for EC-SN is limited to a very narrow mass range of ⪉1-1.5 M{\&}sun; width and this mass window can be further decreased if some metallicity scaling factor is applied to the mass loss rate, h) the final fate of SAGB stars is connected to the second dredge-up and this property allowed us to refine the initial mass range for the formation of EC-SN. We find that if the ratio of the mass loss rate to the core growth rate averaged over the post carbon-burning evolution $\zeta$ = |overline{dot M}_loss/overline{dot M}_core| is greater than about 70-90, the evolutionary path to EC-SN is not accessible.

abstract = {Context. It is generally accepted today that Galactic globular clusters (GGCs) consist of at least two generations of stars that are different in their chemical composition and perhaps age. However, knowledge about the kinematical properties of these stellar generations, which may provide important information for constraining evolutionary scenarios of the GGCs, is still limited. Aims: We study the connections between chemical and kinematical properties of different stellar generations in the Galactic globular cluster 47 Tuc. Methods: To achieve this goal, we used abundances of Li, O, and Na determined in 101 main sequence turn-off (TO) stars with the aid of 3D hydrodynamical model atmospheres and NLTE abundance analysis methodology. We divided our sample TO stars into three groups according to their position in the [Li/Na] - [Na/O] plane to study their spatial distribution and kinematical properties. Results: We find that there are statistically significant radial dependencies of lithium and oxygen abundances, A(Li) and A(O), as well as that of [Li/Na] abundance ratio. Our results show that first-generation stars are less centrally concentrated and dynamically hotter than stars belonging to subsequent generations. We also find a significant correlation between the velocity dispersion and O and Na abundance, and between the velocity dispersion and the [Na/O] abundance ratio.},

We also provide colors and magnitudes for the new sequences for T eff < 40,000 K, where the NLTE effects are not dominant. These new calculations provide a homogeneous set of evolutionary tracks appropriate for mass and age determinations for both PG 1159 stars and DO white dwarfs. The calculations are extended down to an effective temperature of 7000 K. We applied these new tracks to redetermine stellar masses and ages of all known DO white dwarfs with spectroscopically determined effective temperatures and gravities, and compare them with previous results. We also compare for the first time consistent mass determinations for both DO and PG 1159 stars, and find a considerably higher mean mass for the DO white dwarfs. We discuss as well the chemical profile expected in the envelope of variable DB white dwarfs from the consideration of the evolutionary history of progenitor stars. Finally, we present tentative evidence for a different evolutionary channel, other than that involving the PG 1159 stars, for the formation of hot, hydrogen-deficient white dwarfs.},

abstract = {The studies focused on the thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch phase experienced by low- and intermediate-mass stars are extremely important in many astrophysical contexts. In particular, a detailed computation of their chemical yields is essential for several issues, ranging from the chemical evolution of galaxies to the mechanisms behind the formation of globular clusters. Among all the uncertainties affecting the theoretical modelling of this phase, and described in the literature, it remains to be fully clarified which results are severely affected by the use of inadequate low-temperature opacities, which are in most cases calculated on the basis of the original chemical composition of the stars, and do not consider the changes in the surface chemistry due to the occurrence of the third dredge-up and hot-bottom burning. Our investigation is aimed at investigating this point. By means of full evolutionary models including a new set of molecular opacities computed specifically with the SOPUS tool, we highlight which stellar models, among those present in the literature, need a substantial revision, mainly in relation to the predicted chemical yields. The interplay among convection, hot-bottom burning and the low-temperature opacity treatment is also discussed.},

We have obtained high-resolution and high signal-to-noise spectra of 12 probable stream members using the Magellan Inamori Kyocera Echelle spectrograph on the Magellan-Clay Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory and the 2dCoude spectrograph on the Smith Telescope at McDonald Observatory. We have derived abundances or upper limits for 51 species of 46 elements in each of these stars. The stream members show a range of metallicity (-3.4 < [Fe/H] <-1.5) but are otherwise chemically homogeneous, with the same star-to-star dispersion in [X/Fe] as the rest of the halo. This implies that, in principle, a significant fraction of the Milky Way stellar halo could have formed from accreted systems like the stream. The stream stars show minimal evolution in the $\alpha$ or Fe-group elements over the range of metallicity. This stream is enriched with material produced by the main and weak components of the rapid neutron-capture process and shows no evidence for enrichment by the slow neutron-capture process.

In this article we summarise the main steps and contributions that led to one of the most exciting discoveries ever made, of which Lema\^itre was the principal architect. In 1927 he combined his dynamical solutions of the Einstein equations with astronomical observations to conclude that the universe is expanding. He derived the linear velocity-distance relationship and calculated the first numerical value of what later was called the "Hubble constant". His discovery paper of 1927 was written in French and in 1931 it was translated into English and published in Monthly Notices. However, the translation omits the section where Lema\^itre computed the "Hubble constant". Why was that done, and who was responsible? We do not speculate on this question, but present in a very condensed way the facts along the path of discovery. The documented details from primary sources can be found in our book "Discovering the Expanding Universe".},

abstract = {We discuss the evolution of oxygen, carbon and nitrogen in galaxies of different morphological type by adopting detailed chemical evolution models with different star formation histories (continuous star formation or starbursts). In all the models detailed nucleosynthesis prescriptions from supernovae of all types and low- and intermediate-mass stars are taken into account. We start by computing chemical evolution models for the Milky Way with different stellar nucleosynthesis prescriptions. Then, a comparison between model results and `key' observational constraints allows us to choose the best set of stellar yields. Once the best set of yields is identified for the Milky Way, we apply the same nucleosynthesis prescriptions to other spirals (in particular M101) and dwarf irregular galaxies. We compare our model predictions with the [C,N,O/Fe] versus [Fe/H], log(C/O) versus 12 + log(O/H), log(N/O) versus 12+ log(O/H) and [C/O] versus [Fe/H] relations observed in the solar vicinity and draw the following conclusions. (i) There is no need to invoke strong stellar winds in massive stars in order to explain the evolution of the C/O ratio, as often claimed in the literature. (ii) The predicted [O/Fe] ratio as a function of metallicity is in very good agreement with the most recent data available for the solar vicinity, especially for halo stars. This fact again suggests that the oxygen stellar yields in massive stars computed by either Woosley {\&} Weaver or Thielemann, Nomoto {\&} Hashimoto without taking into account mass loss, reproduce the observations well. (iii) We predict that the gap observed in the [Fe/O] versus [O/H] at [O/H]{\textasciitilde}-0.3 dex should be observed also in C/O versus O/H. The existence of such a gap is predicted by our model for the Milky Way and is caused by a halt in the star formation between the end of the thick disc and the beginning of the thin disc phase. Such a halt is produced by the adopted threshold gas density for the star formation rate. (iv) This threshold is also responsible for the prediction of a very slow chemical enrichment between the time of formation of the solar system (4.5 Gyr ago) and the present time, in agreement with new abundance measurements. (v) The chemical evolution models for dwarf irregulars and spirals, adopting the same nucleosynthesis prescriptions of the best model for the solar neighbourhood, well reproduce the available constraints for these objects. (vi) By taking into account the results obtained for all the studied galaxies (Milky Way, M101, dwarf galaxies and DLAs) we conclude that there is no need for claiming a strong primary component of N produced in massive stars (M > 10 Msolar). (vii) Moreover, there is a strong indication that C and N are mainly produced in low- and intermediate-mass stars, at variance with recent suggestions that most of the C should come from massive stars. In particular, intermediate-mass stars with masses between 4 and 8 Msolar contribute mostly to N (both primary and secondary) whereas those with masses between 1 and 3 Msolar contribute mostly to C. At the same time, our results suggest that the C yields computed for massive stars, without taking into account stellar rotation, are underestimated and should be at least a factor of 3 larger than the current values.},

abstract = {We present a new version of the fast star cluster evolution code EVOLVE ME A CLUSTER OF STARS (EMACSS). While previous versions of EMACSS reproduced clusters of single-mass stars, this version models clusters with an evolving stellar content. Stellar evolution dominates early evolution, and leads to: (1) reduction of the mean mass of stars due to the mass loss of high-mass stars; (2) expansion of the half-mass radius; (3) for (nearly) Roche Volume filling clusters, the induced escape of stars. Once sufficient relaxation has occurred (≃10 relaxation times-scales), clusters reach a second, `balanced' state whereby the core releases energy as required by the cluster as a whole. In this state: (1) stars escape due to tidal effects faster than before balanced evolution; (2) the half-mass radius expands or contracts depending on the Roche volume filling factor; and (3) the mean mass of stars increases due to the preferential ejection of low-mass stars. We compare the EMACSS results of several cluster properties against N-body simulations of clusters spanning a range of initial number of stars, mass, half-mass radius, and tidal environments, and show that our prescription accurately predicts cluster evolution for this data base. Finally, we consider applications for EMACSS, such as studies of galactic globular cluster populations in cosmological simulations.},

On the basis of multiband colour-magnitude diagrams, we confirm the existence of multiple stellar populations along the red giant branch (RGB).

We find that (1) the [Ca/H] variations between first and second generation stars are tiny in most GCs ({\textasciitilde}0.02-0.03 dex, comparable with typical observational errors). In addition, (2) using a large sample of red giants in M 4 with abundances from UVES spectra from Marino et al., we find that Ca and Fe abundances in the two populations of Na-poor and Na-rich stars are identical. These facts suggest that the separation seen in color-magnitude diagrams using the U band or hk index (as observed in NGC 1851 by Han et al.) are not due to Ca variations. Small differences in [Ca/H] as associated with hk variations might be due to a small systematic effect in abundance analysis, because most O-poor/Na-rich (He-rich) stars have slightly larger [Fe/H] (by 0.027 dex on average, due to decreased H in the ratio) than first generation stars and are then located at redder positions in the V, hk plane. While a few GCs (M 54, $\omega$ Cen, M 22, maybe even NGC 1851) do actually show various degree of metallicity spread, our findings eliminate the need of a close link between the enrichment by core-collapse supernovae with the mechanism responsible for the Na-O anticorrelation.

This double sequence is consistent with the idea that the cluster hosts two stellar populations: (1) a primordial population that has a composition similar to field stars, containing {\textasciitilde}30% of the stars, and (2) a second generation with enhanced sodium and nitrogen, depleted carbon and oxygen, and a slightly enhanced helium abundance ($\Delta$Y {\textasciitilde} 0.01). We examine the color difference between the two sequences across a variety of color baselines and find that the second sequence is anomalously faint in m F336W.

abstract = {We present a homogeneous chemical abundance analysis of 16 elements in 190 metal-poor Galactic halo stars (38 program and 152 literature objects). The sample includes 171 stars with [Fe/H] <= -2.5, of which 86 are extremely metal poor, [Fe/H] <= -3.0. Our program stars include 10 new objects with [Fe/H] <= -3.5. We identify a sample of "normal" metal-poor stars and measure the trends between [X/Fe] and [Fe/H], as well as the dispersion about the mean trend for this sample. Using this mean trend, we identify objects that are chemically peculiar relative to "normal" stars at the same metallicity. These chemically unusual stars include CEMP-no objects, one star with high [Si/Fe], another with high [Ba/Sr], and one with unusually low [X/Fe] for all elements heavier than Na. The Sr and Ba abundances indicate that there may be two nucleosynthetic processes at lowest metallicity that are distinct from the main r-process. Finally, for many elements, we find a significant trend between [X/Fe] versus T eff, which likely reflects non-LTE and/or three-dimensional effects. Such trends demonstrate that care must be exercised when using abundance measurements in metal-poor stars to constrain chemical evolution and/or nucleosynthesis predictions. This paper includes data gathered with the 6.5 m Magellan Telescopes located at Las Campanas Observatory, Chile. Based on observations collected at the European Organisation for Astronomical Research in the Southern Hemisphere, Chile (proposal 281.D-5015).},

abstract = {We have carried out photodisintegration cross-section measurements on Kr86 using monoenergetic photon beams ranging from the neutron separation energy, Sn=9.86MeV, to 13 MeV. We combine our experimental Kr86($\gamma$,n)Kr85 cross section with results from our recent Kr86($\gamma$,$\gamma$') measurement below the neutron separation energy to obtain the complete nuclear dipole response of Kr86. The new experimental information is used to predict the neutron capture cross section of Kr85, an important branching point nucleus on the abundance flow path during s-process nucleosynthesis. Our new and more precise Kr85(n,$\gamma$)Kr86 cross section allows us to produce more precise predictions of the Kr86 abundance from s-process models. In particular, we find that the models of the s process in asymptotic giant branch stars of mass <1.5M⊙, where the C13 neutron source burns convectively rather than radiatively, represent a possible solution for the highest Kr86∶Kr82 ratios observed in meteoritic stardust SiC grains.},

abstract = {Accurate, quantitative abundances are presented for Fe, Ca, Na, Al, and O in four red giants in the bimodal-CN globular cluster M4. Two of the giants are CN-strong and two are CN-weak: all have very similar magnitudes and colors and, thus, have similar effective temperatures and surface gravities. This analysis utilizes high-resolution, high-SN spectra and up-to-date model atmospheres. For the low-ionization element Na, detailed non-LTE calculations demonstrate that, for lines used in the abundance analysis, departures from LTE are small (less than or approximately equal to 0.1 dex). As a group, these four M4 giants have homogeneous Fe and Ca abundances, while Na, Al, and O vary: the CN-strong stars have larger Na and Al but smaller O abundances than the CN-weak stars. When compared to field metal-poor stars, the CN-weak stars resemble the field stars, while the CN-strong stars are Na and Al rich.},

abstract = {In this paper we describe a new UV-initiative Hubble Space Telescope project (GO-13297) that will complement the existing F606W and F814W database of the Advanced Camera for Surveys Globular Cluster (GC) Treasury by imaging most of its clusters through UV/blue WFC3/UVIS filters F275W, F336W, and F438W. This {\textquotedblleft}magic trio{\textquotedblright} of filters has shown an uncanny ability to disentangle and characterize multiple population (MP) patterns in GCs in a way that is exquisitely sensitive to C, N, and O abundance variations. Combination of these passbands with those in the optical also gives the best leverage for measuring helium enrichment. The dozen clusters that had previously been observed in these bands exhibit a bewildering variety of MP patterns, and the new survey will map the full variance of the phenomenon. The ubiquity of multiple stellar generations in GCs has made the formation of these cornerstone objects more intriguing than ever; GC formation and the origin of their MPs have now become one and the same problem. In this paper we will describe the database and our data reduction strategy, as well as the uses we intend to make of the final photometry, astrometry, and PMs. We will also present preliminary color-magnitude diagrams from the data so far collected. These diagrams also draw on data from GO-12605 and GO-12311, which served as a pilot project for the present GO-13297. Based on observations with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by AURA, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555.},

High-resolution spectroscopy has established that, while most GCs are mono-metallic with no significant abundance spread in s-elements, in all the globulars studied to date the presence of different stellar generation is inferred by the Na-O and the C-N anticorrelations. In this context, NGC 1851 and NGC 6656 are among the most intriguing clusters. Contrary to the majority of GCs, they host two groups of stars with different s-elements abundance that are clearly associated to the two distinct sub-giant and red-giant branches detected in their color-magnitude diagrams (CMD). In the case of NGC 6656 s-rich stars are also enriched in iron and calcium. Each s-element group exhibits its own Na-O and C-N anticorrelations thus indicating the presence of sub-populations and suggesting that the parent clusters have experienced a very complex star-formation history. In this paper we summarize the properties of multiple populations in NGC 1851 and NGC 6656.},

abstract = {Within the Local Universe galaxies can be studied in great detail star by star, and here we review the results of quantitative studies in nearby dwarf galaxies. The color-magnitude diagram synthesis method is well established as the most accurate way to determine star-formation histories of galaxies back to the earliest times. This approach received a large boost from the exceptional data sets that wide-field CCD imagers on the ground and the Hubble Space Telescope could provide. Spectroscopic studies using large ground-based telescopes such as VLT, Magellan, Keck, and HET have allowed the determination of abundances and kinematics for significant samples of stars in nearby dwarf galaxies. These studies have shown how the properties of stellar populations can vary spatially and temporally. This leads to important constraints to theories of galaxy formation and evolution. The combination of spectroscopy and imaging and what they have taught us about dwarf galaxy formation and evolution is the aim of this review.},

abstract = {A recent analysis comparing the [Na/Fe] distributions of red giant branch (RGB) and asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars in the Galactic globular cluster NGC 6752 found that the ratio of Na-poor to Na-rich stars changes from 30:70 on the RGB to 100:0 on the AGB. The surprising paucity of Na-rich stars on the AGB in NGC 6752 warrants additional investigations to determine if the failure of a significant fraction of stars to ascend the AGB is an attribute common to all globular clusters. Therefore, we present radial velocities, [Fe/H], and [Na/Fe] abundances for 35 AGB stars in the Galactic globular cluster 47 Tucanae (47 Tuc; NGC 104), and compare the AGB [Na/Fe] distribution with a similar RGB sample published previously. The abundances and velocities were derived from high-resolution spectra obtained with the Michigan/Magellan Fiber System and MSpec spectrograph on the Magellan-Clay 6.5 m telescope. We find the average heliocentric radial velocity and [Fe/H] values to be < R{{V}helio.}> = -18.56 km s-1 ($\sigma$ = 10.21 km s-1) and < [Fe/H]> = -0.68 ($\sigma$ = 0.08), respectively, in agreement with previous literature estimates. The average [Na/Fe] abundance is 0.12 dex lower in the 47 Tuc AGB sample compared to the RGB sample, and the ratio of Na-poor to Na-rich stars is 63:37 on the AGB and 45:55 on the RGB. However, in contrast to NGC 6752, the two 47 Tuc populations have nearly identical [Na/Fe] dispersion and interquartile range values. The data presented here suggest that only a small fraction (≲20%) of Na-rich stars in 47 Tuc may fail to ascend the AGB, which is a similar result to that observed in M13. Regardless of the cause for the lower average [Na/Fe] abundance in AGB stars, we find that Na-poor stars and at least some Na-rich stars in 47 Tuc evolve through the early AGB phase. The contrasting behavior of Na-rich stars in 47 Tuc and NGC 6752 suggests that the RGB [Na/Fe] abundance alone is insufficient for predicting if a star will ascend the AGB.},

abstract = {The ACS Survey of Galactic globular clusters is a Hubble Space Telescope Treasury program designed to provide a new large, deep, and homogeneous photometric database. Based on observations from this program, we have measured precise relative ages for a sample of 64 Galactic globular clusters by comparing the relative position of the clusters' main-sequence (MS) turnoffs, using MS fitting to cross-compare clusters within the sample. This method provides relative ages to a formal precision of 2%-7%. We demonstrate that the calculated relative ages are independent of the choice of theoretical model. We find that the Galactic globular cluster sample can be divided into two groups{\textemdash}a population of old clusters with an age dispersion of {\textasciitilde}5% and no age-metallicity relation, and a group of younger clusters with an age-metallicity relation similar to that of the globular clusters associated with the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy. These results are consistent with the Milky Way halo having formed in two phases or processes. The first one would be compatible with a rapid (<0.8 Gyr) assembling process of the halo, in which the clusters in the old group were formed. Also these clusters could have been formed before re-ionization in dwarf galaxies that would later merge to build the Milky Way halo as predicted by $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. However, the galactocentric metallicity gradient shown by these clusters seems difficult to reconcile with the latter. As for the younger clusters, it is very tempting to argue that their origin is related to their formation within Milky Way satellite galaxies that were later accreted, but the origin of the age-metallicity relation remains unclear.},

abstract = {Aims: We determine the metallicities of globular clusters (GCs) in the WLM and IKN dwarf galaxies, using VLT/UVES and Keck/ESI spectroscopy. These measurements are combined with literature data for field stars to constrain GC formation scenarios. For the WLM GC, we also measure detailed abundance ratios for a number of light, $\alpha$, Fe-peak, and n-capture elements, which are compared with literature data for the Fornax dSph and the Milky Way. Methods: The abundances are derived by computing synthetic integrated-light model spectra and adjusting the input composition until the best fits to the observed spectra are obtained. Results: We find low metallicities of [Fe/H] = -2.0 and -2.1 for the WLM GC and the GC IKN-5, respectively. We estimate that 17%-31% of the stars with [Fe/H] $\le$ -2 in WLM belong to the GC, and IKN-5 may even contain a similar number of metal-poor stars as the whole of the IKN dwarf itself. While these fractions are much higher than in the Milky Way halo, we have previously found a similarly high ratio of metal-poor GCs to field stars in the Fornax dSph. The overall abundance patterns in the WLM GC are similar to those observed for GCs in the Fornax dSph: the [Ca/Fe] and [Ti/Fe] ratios are super-Solar at about +0.3 dex, while [Mg/Fe] is less elevated than [Ca/Fe] and [Ti/Fe]. The [Na/Fe] ratio is similar to the averaged [Na/Fe] ratios in Milky Way GCs, but higher (by {\textasciitilde}2$\sigma$) than those of Milky Way halo stars. Iron-peak (Mn, Sc, Cr) and heavy elements (Ba, Y, La) generally follow the trends seen in the Milky Way halo. Conclusions: The GCs in the WLM and IKN dwarf galaxies resemble those in the Fornax dSph by being significantly more metal-poor than a typical halo GC in the Milky Way and other large galaxies. They are also substantially more metal-poor than the bulk of the field stars in their parent galaxies. It appears that only a small fraction of the Milky Way GC system could have been accreted from galaxies similar to these dwarfs. The relatively high Na abundance in the WLM GC suggests that the [Na/O] anti-correlation is present in this cluster, while the high ratios of metal-poor GCs to field stars in the dwarfs are in tension with GC formation scenarios that require GCs to have lost a very large fraction of their initial mass.

abstract = {Context. The study of chemical abundance patterns in globular clusters is key importance to constraining the different candidates for intracluster pollution of light elements. Aims: We aim at deriving accurate abundances for a wide range of elements in the globular cluster 47 Tucanae (NGC 104) to add new constraints to the pollution scenarios for this particular cluster, expanding the range of previously derived element abundances. Methods: Using tailored 1D local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) atmospheric models, together with a combination of equivalent width measurements, LTE, and NLTE synthesis, we derive stellar parameters and element abundances from high-resolution, high signal-to-noise spectra of 13 red giant stars near the tip of the RGB. Results: We derive abundances of a total 27 elements (O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Y, Zr, Mo, Ru, Ba, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Eu, Dy). Departures from LTE were taken into account for Na, Al, and Ba. We find a mean [Fe/H] = -0.78 {\textpm} 0.07 and [ $\alpha$/ Fe ] = 0.34 {\textpm} 0.03 in good agreement with previous studies. The remaining elements show good agreement with the literature, but including NLTE for Al has a significant impact on the behavior of this key element. Conclusions: We confirm the presence of an Na-O anti-correlation in 47 Tucanae found by several other works. Our NLTE analysis of Al shifts the [Al/Fe] to lower values, indicating that this may be overestimated in earlier works. No evidence of an intrinsic variation is found in any of the remaining elements.

abstract = {Context. Globular clusters host multiple stellar populations showing different sodium enrichments. These various populations can be observed along the main sequence, red giant and horizontal branch phases. Recently it was shown, however, that at least in the globular cluster NGC 6752, no sodium-rich stars are observed along the early asymptotic giant branch (AGB), posing an apparent problem for stellar evolution. Aims: We present an explanation for this lack of sodium-rich stars in this region of the colour-magnitude diagram. Methods: We computed models for low-mass stars following the prediction of the so-called fast rotating massive stars model for the initial composition of second-generation stars. We studied the impact of different initial helium contents on the stellar lifetimes and the evolutionary path in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. Results: We propose that the lack of sodium-rich stars along the early-AGB arises because sodium-rich stars were born with a high initial helium abundance, as predicted by the fast rotating massive stars scenario. Helium-rich stars have much shorter lifetimes for a given initial mass than stars with a normal helium abundance, and above a cutoff initial helium abundance that slightly depends on the mass-loss rate on the RGB they do not go through the AGB phase and evolve directly into a white dwarf stage. Within the fast rotating massive stars framework we obtained a cutoff in [Na/Fe] between the second-generation models evolving into the AGB phase and those skipping that phase between 0.18 and 0.4 dex, depending on the mass loss rate used during the red giant phase. In view of the uncertainties in abundance determinations, the cutoff obtained by the present model agrees well with the one inferred from recent observations of the cluster NGC 6752. Conclusions: The helium-sodium correlation needed to explain the lack of sodium-rich stars along the early-AGB of NGC 6752 corresponds to the one predicted by the fast rotating massive stars models. A crucial additional test of the model is the distribution of stars with various helium abundances among main-sequence stars. Our model predicts that two magnitudes below the turnoff a very large percentage of stars, about 82%, probably has a helium content lower than 0.275 in mass fraction, while only 5% of stars are expected to have helium abundances greater than 0.4.},

abstract = {Stellar physics and evolution calculations enable a broad range of research in astrophysics. Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) is a suite of open source, robust, efficient, thread-safe libraries for a wide range of applications in computational stellar astrophysics. A one-dimensional stellar evolution module, MESAstar, combines many of the numerical and physics modules for simulations of a wide range of stellar evolution scenarios ranging from very low mass to massive stars, including advanced evolutionary phases. MESAstar solves the fully coupled structure and composition equations simultaneously. It uses adaptive mesh refinement and sophisticated timestep controls, and supports shared memory parallelism based on OpenMP. State-of-the-art modules provide equation of state, opacity, nuclear reaction rates, element diffusion data, and atmosphere boundary conditions. Each module is constructed as a separate Fortran 95 library with its own explicitly defined public interface to facilitate independent development. Several detailed examples indicate the extensive verification and testing that is continuously performed and demonstrate the wide range of capabilities that MESA possesses. These examples include evolutionary tracks of very low mass stars, brown dwarfs, and gas giant planets to very old ages; the complete evolutionary track of a 1 M sun star from the pre-main sequence (PMS) to a cooling white dwarf; the solar sound speed profile; the evolution of intermediate-mass stars through the He-core burning phase and thermal pulses on the He-shell burning asymptotic giant branch phase; the interior structure of slowly pulsating B Stars and Beta Cepheids; the complete evolutionary tracks of massive stars from the PMS to the onset of core collapse; mass transfer from stars undergoing Roche lobe overflow; and the evolution of helium accretion onto a neutron star. MESA can be downloaded from the project Web site (http://mesa.sourceforge.net/).},

abstract = {From newly obtained high-resolution, high signal-to-noise ratio spectra the abundances of the elements La and Eu have been determined over the stellar metallicity range -3<[Fe/H]<+0.3 in 159 giant and dwarf stars. Lanthanum is predominantly made by the s-process in the solar system, while Eu owes most of its solar system abundance to the r-process. The changing ratio of these elements in stars over a wide metallicity range traces the changing contributions of these two processes to the Galactic abundance mix. Large s-process abundances can be the result of mass transfer from very evolved stars, so to identify these cases we also report carbon abundances in our metal-poor stars. Results indicate that the s-process may be active as early as [Fe/H]=-2.6, although we also find that some stars as metal-rich as [Fe/H]=-1 show no strong indication of s-process enrichment. There is a significant spread in the level of s-process enrichment even at solar metallicity.},

abstract = {We report new metallicities for stars of Galactic globular cluster M4 using the largest number of stars ever observed at high spectral resolution in any cluster. We analyzed 7250 spectra for 2771 cluster stars gathered with the Very Large Telescope (VLT) FLAMES+GIRAFFE spectrograph at VLT. These medium-resolution spectra cover a small wavelength range, and often have very low signal-to-noise ratios. We approached this data set by reconsidering the whole method of abundance analysis of large stellar samples from beginning to end. We developed a new algorithm that automatically determines the atmospheric parameters of a star. Nearly all of the data preparation steps for spectroscopic analyses are processed on the syntheses, not the observed spectra. For 322 red giant branch (RGB) stars with V <= 14.7, we obtain a nearly constant metallicity, lang[Fe/H]rang = -1.07 ($\sigma$ = 0.02). No difference in the metallicity at the level of 0.01 dex is observed between the two RGB sequences identified by Monelli et al. For 1869 subgiant and main-sequence stars with V > 14.7, we obtain lang[Fe/H]rang = -1.16 ($\sigma$ = 0.09) after fixing the microturbulent velocity. These values are consistent with previous studies that have performed detailed analyses of brighter RGB stars at higher spectroscopic resolution and wavelength coverage. It is not clear if the small mean metallicity difference between brighter and fainter M4 members is real or is the result of the low signal-to-noise characteristics of the fainter stars. The strength of our approach is shown by recovering a metallicity close to a single value for more than 2000 stars, using a data set that is non-optimal for atmospheric analyses. This technique is particularly suitable for noisy data taken in difficult observing conditions.},

abstract = {Abundances of Ca, Na, and Fe are derived for 10 red giant branch stars in the globular clusters M13 and M22, by means of model atmosphere analyses of high-dispersion spectra. It was found that M13 and M22 represent two different types of globular clusters. M13 is similar to M92 and many other globular clusters in that it displays variations in CH and CN band strengths, while showing no variation in either Ca or Fe abundance. The Na abundance was found to vary and its variation correlates with CN band strengths. This suggests that the source of the observed CN band strength variation is the same as that of the Na variation. M22, on the other hand, is similar to Omega Cen, in that it displays variations in Ca, Na, and Fe abundances, and these variations correlate with variations in CH and CN band strengths. These correlations suggest that the cause of the variations in M22 is largely 'primordial,' and that mixing may only make a relatively small contribution to the C and N variations observed.},

The impact of nuclear physics uncertainties on the derived abundances is discussed in the framework of a simple parametric astrophysical model. These calculations have the virtue of being a guide in the selection of the nuclear uncertainties that have to be duly analyzed in detailed model stars, particularly in order to perform meaningful confrontations between abundance observations and predictions. They are also hoped to help nuclear astrophysicists pinpointing the rate uncertainties that have to be reduced most urgently.

abstract = {We have observed 15 red giant stars in the relatively massive, metal-poor globular cluster NGC 4833 using the Magellan Inamori Kyocera Echelle spectrograph at Magellan. We calculate stellar parameters for each star and perform a standard abundance analysis to derive abundances of 43 species of 39 elements, including 20 elements heavier than the iron group. We derive <[Fe/H]> = -2.25 {\textpm} 0.02 from Fe I lines and <[Fe/H]> = -2.19 {\textpm} 0.013 from Fe II lines. We confirm earlier results that found no internal metallicity spread in NGC 4833, and there are no significant star-to-star abundance dispersions among any elements in the iron group (19 $\le$Z $\le$ 30). We recover the usual abundance variations among the light elements C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, and possibly Si. The heavy-element distribution reflects enrichment by r-process nucleosynthesis ([Eu/Fe] = +0.36 {\textpm} 0.03), as found in many other metal-poor globular clusters. We investigate small star-to-star variations found among the neutron-capture elements, and we conclude that these are probably not real variations. Upper limits on the Th abundance, log e (Th/Eu) < -0.47 {\textpm} 0.09, indicate that NGC 4833, like other globular clusters where Th has been studied, did not experience a so-called actinide boost.},

abstract = {Recent observations of carbon, sulphur and titanium isotopes at redshifts z{\textasciitilde}1 and in the local stellar disc and halo have opened a new window into the study of isotopic abundance patterns and the origin of the chemical elements. Using our Galactic chemical evolution code GETOOL, we have examined the evolution of these isotopes within the framework of a Milky Way-like system. We have three aims in this work: first, to test the claim that novae are required, in order to explain the carbon isotope patterns in the Milky Way; secondly, to test the claim that sulphur isotope patterns at high redshift require an initial mass function (IMF) biased towards massive stars; and thirdly, to test extant chemical evolution models against new observations of titanium isotopes that suggest an anti-correlation between trace-to-dominant isotopes with metallicity. Based upon our dual-infall galactic chemical evolution modelling of a Milky Way-like system and the subsequent comparison with these new and unique data sets, we conclude the following: novae are not required to understand the evolution of 12C/13C in the solar neighbourhood; a massive star-biased IMF is consistent with the low ratios of 12C/13C and 32S/34S seen in one high-redshift late-type spiral, but the consequent super-solar metallicity prediction for the interstellar medium in this system seems highly unlikely; and deficient isotopes of titanium are predicted to correlate positively with metallicity, in apparent disagreement with the new data sets; if confirmed, classical chemical evolution models of the Milky Way (and the associated supernovae nucleosynthetic yields) may need a substantial overhaul to be made consistent.},

abstract = {Context. The photospheric abundances of evolved solar-type stars of different metallicities serve as probes into stellar evolution theory. Aims: Stellar photospheres of post-asymptotic giant branch (post-AGB) stars bear witness to the internal chemical enrichment processes, integrated over their entire stellar evolution. Here we study post-AGB stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). With their known distances, these rare objects are ideal tracers of AGB nucleosynthesis and dredge-up phenomena. Methods: We used the UVES spectrograph mounted on the Very Large Telescope at the European Southern Observatory, to obtain high-resolution spectra with high signal-to-noise of a sample of four post-AGB stars. The objects display a spectral energy distribution that indicates the presence of circumstellar dust. We perform a detailed abundance analysis on the basis of these spectra. Results: All objects are C-rich, and strongly enhanced in s-process elements. We deduced abundances of heavy s-process elements for all stars in the sample, and even found an indication of the presence of Hg in the spectrum of one object. The metallicity of all stars except J053253.51-695915.1 is considerably lower than the average value that is observed for the LMC. The derived luminosities show that we witness the late evolution of low-mass stars with initial masses close to 1 M⊙. An exception is J053253.51-695915.1 and we argue that this object is likely a binary. Conclusions: We confirmed the correlation between the efficiency of the third-dredge up and the neutron exposure that is detected in Galactic post-AGB stars. The non-existence of a correlation between metallicity and neutron irradiation is also confirmed and expanded to smaller metallicities. We confirm the status of 21 $\mu$m stars as post-carbon stars. Current theoretical AGB models overestimate the observed C/O ratios and fail to reproduce the variety of s-process abundance patterns that is observed in otherwise very similar objects. Similar results have recently been found for a post-AGB star in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC).

abstract = {We present a Spitzer Space Telescope spectroscopic study of a sample of 25 planetary nebulae (PNe) in the Magellanic Clouds (MCs). The low-resolution modules are used to analyze the dust features present in the infrared spectra. This study complements a previous work by the same authors where the same sample was analyzed in terms of neon and sulfur abundances. Over half of the objects (14) show emission of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, typical of carbon-rich dust environments. We compare the hydrocarbon emission in our objects to those of Galactic H II regions and PNe, and Large Magellanic Cloud/Small Magellanic Cloud H II regions. Amorphous silicates are seen in just two objects, enforcing the now well known fact that oxygen-rich dust is less common at low metallicities. Besides these common features, some PNe show very unusual dust. Nine objects show a strong silicon carbide feature at 11 $\mu$m and 12 of them show magnesium sulfide emission starting at 25 $\mu$m. The high percentage of spectra with silicon carbide in the MCs is not common. Two objects show a broadband which may be attributed to hydrogenated amorphous carbon and weak low-excitation atomic lines. It is likely that these nebulae are very young. The spectra of the remaining eight nebulae are dominated by the emission of fine-structure lines with a weak continuum due to thermal emission of dust, although in a few cases the signal-to-noise ratio in the spectra is low, and weak dust features may not have been detected.},

abstract = {Abundances of Ca, Na, and Fe are derived for 10 red giant branch stars in the globular clusters M13 and M22, by means of model atmosphere analyses of high-dispersion spectra. It was found that M13 and M22 represent two different types of globular clusters. M13 is similar to M92 and many other globular clusters in that it displays variations in CH and CN band strengths, while showing no variation in either Ca or Fe abundance. The Na abundance was found to vary and its variation correlates with CN band strengths. This suggests that the source of the observed CN band strength variation is the same as that of the Na variation. M22, on the other hand, is similar to Omega Cen, in that it displays variations in Ca, Na, and Fe abundances, and these variations correlate with variations in CH and CN band strengths. These correlations suggest that the cause of the variations in M22 is largely 'primordial,' and that mixing may only make a relatively small contribution to the C and N variations observed.},

Enhanced levels of [Ba/Y] in stars in dwarf spheroidals like Sculptor indicate strong s-process production from low-mass stars whose lifetimes are comparable with the duration of the pre-reionization epoch. The chemical evolution of Sculptor is followed using a model with SN II and SN Ia feedback and mass- and metallicity-dependent nucleosynthetic yields for elements from H to Pb. We are unable to reproduce the Ba/Y ratio unless stars formed over an interval long enough for the low-mass stars to pollute the interstellar medium with s-elements. This robust result challenges the suggestion that most of the local group dwarf spheroidals are fossils of reionization and supports the case for large initial dark matter halos.},

With this data base, s-process studies have been carried out using the traditional model which assumes a steady neutron flux and an exponential distribution of neutron irradiations. The calculated sigma-N curve is in excellent agreement with the empirical sigma-N-values of pure s-process nuclei. Simultaneously, good agreement is found between the difference of solar and s-process abundances and the abundances of pure r-process nuclei. The abundance pattern of the iron group elements where s-process results complement the abundances obtained from explosive nuclear burning is discussed. The results obtained from the traditional s-process model such as seed abundances, mean neutron irradiations, or neutron densities are compared to recent stellar model calculations which assume the He-burning shells of red giant stars as the site for the s-process.},

abstract = {We carry out the first multi-dimensional radiative transfer calculations to simultaneously compute synthetic spectra and light curves for models of supernovae driven by fast bipolar outflows. These allow us to make self-consistent predictions for the orientation dependence of both color evolution and spectral features. We compare models with different degrees of asphericity and metallicity and find significant observable consequences of both. In aspherical models, we find spectral and light curve features that vary systematically with observer orientation. In particular, we find that the early-phase light curves are brighter and bluer when viewed close to the polar axis but that the peak flux is highest for equatorial (off-axis) inclinations. Spectral line features also depend systematically on observer orientation, including the velocity of the Si II 6355 {\AA} line. Consequently, our models predict a correlation between line velocity and color that could assist the identification of supernovae associated with off-axis jet-driven explosions. The amplitude and range of this correlation depends on the degree of asphericity, the metallicity, and the epoch of observation but we find that it is always present and acts in the same direction.},

abstract = {In recent years much interest has been shown in the process of thermohaline mixing in red giants. In low- and intermediate-mass stars this mechanism first activates at the position of the bump in the luminosity function, and has been identified as a likely candidate for driving the slow mixing inferred to occur in these stars. One particularly important consequence of this process, which is driven by a molecular weight inversion, is the destruction of lithium. We show that the degree of lithium destruction, or in some cases production, is extremely sensitive to the numerical details of the stellar models. Within the standard 1D diffusion approximation to thermohaline mixing, we find that different evolution codes, with their default numerical schemes, can produce lithium abundances that differ from one another by many orders of magnitude. This disagreement is worse for faster mixing. We perform experiments with four independent stellar evolution codes, and derive conditions for the spatial and temporal resolution required for a converged numerical solution. The results are extremely sensitive to the time-steps used. We find that predicted lithium abundances published in the literature until now should be treated with caution.},

abstract = {We have computed evolutionary sequences for the asymptotic-giant-branch phase of low-mass stars in order to study a radiation-pressure instability for ejecting a planetary nebula (PN). Our results show that the ratio beta of gas to total pressure at the base of the hydrogen envelope drops abruptly during a helium-shell flash as the envelope expands and the surface luminosity increases. We find that the minimum value of beta decreases from one flash to the next and eventually approaches 0, implying that the entire envelope is then supported by radiation pressure. At this point the luminosity at the base of the envelope reaches the Eddington limit, and the star will most likely eject its hydrogen envelope. The critical envelope mass at PN ejection is found to be a linear function of the core mass MH, varying from {\textasciitilde} 0.03 Mo at MH = 0.64 Mo to {\textasciitilde} 1.04 Mo at MH = 0.91 Mo for a solar metallicity. This critical envelope mass decreases considerably at lower metallicities, suggesting a possible metallicity dependence of the PN luminosity function. The minimum value of beta during a flash occurs at the time when carbon dredge-up is most likely. We suggest that such dredge-up might trigger PN ejection by increasing the opacity and thereby lowering the Eddington luminosity at the base of the envelope. This might explain why the majority of halo PN's, including K648 in M15, as well as the non-Type I PN's in the Magellanic Clouds are carbon rich.},

abstract = {We report on the discovery of a new kind of thermal pulse in intermediate-mass asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. Deep dredge-up during normal thermal pulses on the AGB leads to the formation of a long unburnt tail in the helium profile. Eventually, the tail ignites under partially degenerate conditions, producing a strong shell flash with very deep subsequent dredge-up. The carbon content of the intershell convective region (XC {\textasciitilde} 0.6) is substantially higher than in a normal thermal pulse (XC {\textasciitilde} 0.25), and about 4 times more carbon is dredged up than in a normal pulse.},

abstract = {We reconstruct the history of the cosmic star formation in the universe by means of detailed chemical evolution models for galaxies of different morphological types. We consider a picture of coeval noninteracting evolving galaxies in which elliptical galaxies experience intense and rapid starbursts within the first gigayears after their formation and spiral and irregular galaxies continue to form stars at lower rates up to the present time. Such models allow one to follow in detail the evolution of the metallicity of the gas from which the stars are formed. We normalize the galaxy population to the B-band luminosity function observed in the local universe and study the redshift evolution of the luminosity densities in the B, U, I, and K bands, calculating galaxy colors and evolutionary corrections by means of a detailed synthetic stellar population model. Our predictions indicate that the decline of the galaxy luminosity density between redshift 1 and 0 observed in the U, B, and I bands is caused mainly by star-forming spiral galaxies that slowly exhaust their gas reservoirs. Elliptical galaxies have dominated the total luminosity density in all optical bands at early epochs, when all their stars formed by means of rapid and very intense starbursts. Irregular galaxies bring a negligible contribution to the total luminosity density in any band at any time. We study the cosmic missing-metal crisis and conclude that it could be even more serious than what has been assessed by previous authors, if the bulk of the metals were produced in dust-obscured starbursts associated with the early spheroid formation. The most plausible site for the missing metals could be the warm gas in galaxy groups and protoclusters, in which the metals could have been ejected through galactic winds following intense starbursts. Finally, we predict the evolution of the cosmic star formation and supernova II and Ia rates and obtain the best fit to the observations, assuming a Salpeter initial mass function. All our results indicate that the bulk of the stellar mass in most galaxies were already in place at early epochs, and we predict a peak in the global star formation rate at high redshift because of elliptical galaxies.},

By considering stellar populations of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), we calculate synthetic colour-colour and colour-magnitude diagrams, which are compared with those obtained by the Spitzer Space Telescope. The comparison between observations and theoretical predictions outlines that extremely obscured carbon stars and oxygen-rich sources experiencing hot bottom burning (HBB) occupy well-defined, distinct regions in the colour-colour ([3.6] - [4.5], [5.8] - [8.0]) diagram. The C-rich stars are distributed along a diagonal strip that we interpret as an evolutionary sequence, becoming progressively more obscured as the stellar surface layers enrich in carbon. Their circumstellar envelopes host solid carbon dust grains with size in the range 0.05 < a < 0.2 $\mu$m. The presence of silicon carbide (SiC) particles is expected only in the more metal-rich stars. The reddest sources, with [3.6] - [4.5] > 2, are the descendants of stars with initial mass Min {\~{ }} 2.5-3 M⊙ in the very latest phases of AGB life. The oxygen-rich stars with the reddest colours ([5.8] - [8.0] > 0.6) are those experiencing HBB, the descendants of {\~{ }}5 M⊙ objects formed 108 yr ago; alumina and silicate dust starts forming at different distances from the central star. The overall dust production rate in the LMC is {\~{ }}4.5 {\texttimes} 10-5 M⊙ yr-1, the relative percentages due to C and M stars being 85 and 15 per cent, respectively.},

With a wide range of metallicities, galactocentric distances, and both Type I and non-Type I Peimbert classifications, we've examined the alpha-capture elements against HII regions and blue compact galaxies (H2BCG) in order to ferret out signatures of in situ destruction and enhancement; particularly the depletion/production of O and Ne. In summary we find no observational support for systematic differences between PNe and interstellar alpha element patterns. PN progenitors do not appear to alter their alpha elements to an extent that distinguishes in situ nucleosynthesis from the observed dispersion in abundance ratios. In addition our examination of Ne and the Ne/O ratio, as measured in PNe and H2BCG, presents no indication that Ne/O is metallicity sensitive.},

abstract = {We investigate departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) in the line formation of Fe for a number of well-studied late-type stars in different evolutionary stages. A new model of the Fe atom was constructed from the most up-to-date theoretical and experimental atomic data available so far. Non-LTE (NLTE) line formation calculations for Fe were performed using 1D hydrostatic MARCS and MAFAGS-OS model atmospheres, as well as the spatial and temporal average stratifications from full 3D hydrodynamical simulations of stellar convection computed using the STAGGER code. It is shown that the Fe I/Fe II ionization balance can be well established with the 1D and mean 3D models under NLTE including calibrated inelastic collisions with H I calculated from Drawin's formulae. Strong low-excitation Fe I lines are very sensitive to the atmospheric structure; classical 1D models fail to provide consistent excitation balance, particularly so for cool metal-poor stars. A better agreement between Fe I lines spanning a range of excitation potentials is obtained with the mean 3D models. Mean NLTE metallicities determined for the standard stars using the 1D and mean 3D models are fully consistent. Moreover, the NLTE spectroscopic effective temperatures and gravities from ionization balance agree with that determined by other methods, e.g. the infrared flux method and parallaxes, if one of the stellar parameters is constrained independently.},

abstract = {We present new evolutionary calculations for a 3 solar mass of Population I starting from zero-age main sequence and followed up to the 25th thermal pulse of the asymptotic giant branch. The third dredge-up is found to occur in a self-consistent way from the 14th pulse on. We show that any amount of C-13 possibly synthesized at the H/He interface during the interpulse period is completely burnt through (alpha, n) reactions before the next pulse develops. As a consequence, s-elements are produced in a radiative environment, at a neutron density of at most a few 107 n/cc. There are then engulfed and diluted into the next convective pulse, where a second (minor) neutron burst occurs, driven by the (22) Ne (alpha, n) (25) Mg reaction marginally activated near the end of the He-shell instability. Despite the differences of the present model with respect to past calculations, we predict s-process distributions very close to those computed by allowing C-13 to burn in convective pulses: C-13 burning and the ensuing s-processing are confirmed to account for the main observational and experimental constraints. The reasons for this are briefly discussed. Since no C-13 survives the interpulse phase, we conclude that no modifications of the pulse shape due to the energy feedback from the (13) C (alpha, n) (16) O reaction occur.},

In agreement with the results by other research groups, we find that the O-Ne core is formed via the formation of a convective flame that proceeds to the centre of the star. The evolution, which follows, is strongly determined by the description of the mass-loss mechanism. Use of the traditional formalism with the superwind phase favours a long evolution with many thermal pulses, and the achievement of an advanced nucleosynthesis, due to the large temperatures reached by the bottom of the external mantle. Use of a mass-loss recipe with a strong dependence on the luminosity favours an early consumption of the stellar envelope, so that the extent of the nucleosynthesis, and thus the chemical composition of the ejecta, is less extreme. The implications for the multiple populations in globular clusters are discussed. If the {\textquoteleft}extreme{\textquoteright} populations present in the most massive clusters are a result of direct formation from the super asymptotic giant branch (SAGB) ejecta, their abundances may constitute a powerful way of calibrating the mass-loss rate of this phase. This calibration will also provide information on the fraction of SAGBs exploding as single e-capture supernovae, leaving a neutron star remnant in the cluster.},

abstract = {Hubble Space Telescope (HST) WFPC2 archival F606W and F300W images obtained within 1 year prior to the explosion of the nearby Type II supernova (SN) 2003gd in M74 (=NGC 628) have been analyzed to isolate the progenitor star. The SN site was located using precise astrometry applied to the HST images. Two plausible candidates are identified within 0.6" of the SN position in the F606W image. Neither candidate was detected in the F300W image. SN 2003gd appears to be of Type II-plateau (II-P), with age {\textasciitilde}87 days on June 17 UT and with low reddening [E(B-V)=0.13 mag]. The most likely of the two progenitor candidates has MV0{\textasciitilde}-3.5 mag (for an extinction-corrected distance modulus of 29.3 mag), and on the basis of additional color information derived from a high-quality, archival ground-based I-band image, we estimate that this star was a red supergiant with initial (zero-age main sequence) mass MZAMS{\textasciitilde}8-9 Msolar. This mass estimate is somewhat lower than, but relatively consistent with, recent limits placed on the progenitor masses of other SNe II-P, using HST data. Future HST imaging with the HST Advanced Camera for Surveys, when the SN has faded considerably, will be very useful in pinpointing the exact SN location and securing identification of the progenitor. If our proposed candidate is confirmed, it will be only the sixth SN progenitor ever directly identified.

abstract = {Explosions of sub-Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarfs (WDs) are one alternative to the standard Chandrasekhar-mass model of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). They are interesting since binary systems with sub-Chandrasekhar-mass primary WDs should be common and this scenario would suggest a simple physical parameter which determines the explosion brightness, namely the mass of the exploding WD. Here we perform one-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations, associated post-processing nucleosynthesis, and multi-wavelength radiation transport calculations for pure detonations of carbon-oxygen WDs. The light curves and spectra we obtain from these simulations are in good agreement with observed properties of SNe Ia. In particular, for WD masses from 0.97 to 1.15 M sun we obtain 56Ni masses between 0.3 and 0.8 M sun, sufficient to capture almost the complete range of SN Ia brightnesses. Our optical light curve rise times, peak colors, and decline timescales display trends which are generally consistent with observed characteristics although the range of B-band decline timescales displayed by our current set of models is somewhat too narrow. In agreement with observations, the maximum light spectra of the models show clear features associated with intermediate-mass elements and reproduce the sense of the observed correlation between explosion luminosity and the ratio of the Si II lines at $\lambda$6355 and $\lambda$5972. We therefore suggest that sub-Chandrasekhar-mass explosions are a viable model for SNe Ia for any binary evolution scenario leading to explosions in which the optical display is dominated by the material produced in a detonation of the primary WD.},

abstract = {Aims: Our main goals are to get a deeper insight into the evolution and final fates of intermediate-mass, extremely metal-poor (EMP) stars. We also aim to investigate the C, N, and O yields of these stars. Methods: Using the Monash University Stellar Evolution code MONSTAR we computed and analysed the evolution of stars of metallicity Z = 10-5 and masses between 4 and 9 M⊙, from their main sequence until the late thermally pulsing (super) asymptotic giant branch, TP-(S)AGB phase. Results: Our model stars experience a strong C, N, and O envelope enrichment either due to the second dredge-up process, the dredge-out phenomenon, or the third dredge-up early during the TP-(S)AGB phase. Their late evolution is therefore similar to that of higher metallicity objects. When using a standard prescription for the mass loss rates during the TP-(S)AGB phase, the computed stars are able to lose most of their envelopes before their cores reach the Chandrasekhar mass (mCh), so our standard models do not predict the occurrence of SNI1/2 for Z = 10-5 stars. However, we find that the reduction of only one order of magnitude in the mass-loss rates, which are particularly uncertain at this metallicity, would prevent the complete ejection of the envelope, allowing the stars to either explode as an SNI1/2 or become an electron-capture SN. Our calculations stop due to an instability near the base of the convective envelope that hampers further convergence and leaves remnant envelope masses between 0.25 M⊙ for our 4 M⊙ model and 1.5 M⊙ for our 9 M⊙ model. We present two sets of C, N, and O yields derived from our full calculations and computed under two different assumptions, namely, that the instability causes a practically instant loss of the remnant envelope or that the stars recover and proceed with further thermal pulses. Conclusions: Our results have implications for the early chemical evolution of the Universe and might provide another piece for the puzzle of the carbon-enhanced EMP star problem.

abstract = {We present new low-resolution (R {\textasciitilde} 800) optical spectra of 22 Galactic planetary nebulae (PNe) with Spitzer spectra. These data are combined with recent optical spectroscopic data available in the literature to construct representative samples of compact (and presumably young) Galactic disc and bulge PNe with Spitzer spectra. Attending to the nature of the dust features - C-rich, O-rich, and both C- and O-rich dust features (or double chemistry) - seen in their Spitzer spectra, the Galactic disc and bulge PNe are classified according to four major dust types (oxygen chemistry or OC, carbon chemistry or CC, double chemistry or DC, featureless or F) and subtypes (amorphous and crystalline, and aliphatic and aromatic), and their Galactic distributions are presented. Nebular gas abundances of He, N, O, Ne, S, Cl, and Ar, as well as plasma parameters (e.g. Ne, Te) are homogeneously derived by using the classical empirical method. We study the median chemical abundances and nebular properties in Galactic disc and bulge PNe depending on their Spitzer dust types and subtypes. The differences and similarities between PNe in the Galactic disc and bulge are reported. In particular, the median abundances for the major Spitzer dust types CC and OC are representative of the dominant dust subtype (which are different in both Galactic environments), while these values in DC PNe are representative of the two DC subtypes. A comparison of the derived median abundance patterns with AGB nucleosynthesis predictions mainly show that i) DC PNe, both with amorphous and crystalline silicates, display high-metallicity (solar/supra-solar) and the highest He abundances and N/O abundance ratios, suggesting relatively massive ({\textasciitilde}3-5 M⊙) hot bottom burning AGB stars as progenitors; ii) PNe with O-rich and C-rich unevolved dust (amorphous and aliphatic) seem to evolve from subsolar metallicity (z {\textasciitilde} 0.008) and lower mass (<3 M⊙) AGB stars; iii) a few O-rich PNe and a significant fraction of C-rich PNe with more evolved dust (crystalline and aromatic, respectively) display chemical abundances similar to DC PNe, suggesting that they are related objects. A comparison of the derived nebular properties with predictions from models combining the theoretical central star evolution with a simple nebular model is also presented. Finally, a possible link between the Spitzer dust properties, chemical abundances, and evolutionary status is discussed.

abstract = {The formation of globular clusters (GCs) remains one of the main unsolved problems in star and galaxy formation. The past decades have seen important progress in constraining the physics of GC formation from a variety of directions. In this article, we discuss the latest constraints obtained from studies of present-day GC populations, the formation of young massive clusters (YMCs) in the local Universe, and the observed, large-scale conditions for star and cluster formation in high-redshift galaxies. The main conclusion is that the formation of massive, GC progenitor clusters is restricted to high-pressure environments similar to those observed at high redshift and at the sites of YMC formation in the local Universe. However, the correspondingly high gas densities also lead to efficient cluster disruption by impulsive tidal shocks, which limits the survival of GCs progenitor clusters. As a result, the long-term survival of GC progenitor clusters requires them to migrate into the host galaxy halo on a short time-scale. It is proposed that the necessary cluster migration is facilitated by the frequent galaxy mergers occurring at high redshift. We use the available observational and theoretical constraints to condense the current state of the field into a coherent picture of GC formation, in which regular star and cluster formation in high-redshift galaxies naturally leads to the GC populations observed today.},

abstract = {The dark matter halo of the Milky Way is expected to be triaxial and filled with substructure. It is hoped that streams or shells of stars produced by tidal disruption of stellar systems will provide precise measures of the gravitational potential to test these predictions. We develop a method for inferring the Galactic potential with tidal streams based on the idea that the stream stars were once close in phase space. Our method can flexibly adapt to any form for the Galactic potential: it works in phase-space rather than action-space and hence relies neither on our ability to derive actions nor on the integrability of the potential. Our model is probabilistic, with a likelihood function and priors on the parameters. The method can properly account for finite observational uncertainties and missing data dimensions. We test our method on synthetic data sets generated from N-body simulations of satellite disruption in a static, multi-component Milky Way, including a triaxial dark matter halo with observational uncertainties chosen to mimic current and near-future surveys of various stars. We find that with just eight well-measured stream stars, we can infer properties of a triaxial potential with precisions of the order of 5%-7%. Without proper motions, we obtain 10% constraints on most potential parameters and precisions around 5%-10% for recovering missing phase-space coordinates. These results are encouraging for the goal of using flexible, time-dependent potential models combined with larger data sets to unravel the detailed shape of the dark matter distribution around the Milky Way.},

abstract = {New models of thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch (TP-AGB) stars of low mass and solar chemical composition are presented, namely, 1 <= M/M⊙ <= 3, Z = 0.02, and Y = 0.28. The influence of various parameters (such as the initial core mass, the envelope mass, the mass-loss rate, the opacity, and the mixing length) on the properties of the models is discussed in detail. Our main findings are the following: 1. The third dredge-up (TDU) operates self-consistently (using the Schwarzschild criterion for convection and without invoking any extra-mixing) for masses as low as 1.5 M⊙. The minimum core mass for which TDU is found is MH {\textasciitilde} 0.61 M⊙. This value is attained after about 10 thermal pulses, almost independently of the initial mass. 2. During the early TP-AGB evolution, the relation between the pulse strength (i.e., the luminosity peak of the 3 alpha burning during the pulse) and the core mass is in good agreement with previous findings. However, when TDU is settled on, the strength of the pulse increases more rapidly as the penetration of the convective envelope into the He intershell increases. No asymptotic limit is found. 3. Furthermore, the 3 alpha luminosity peak is independent of the previous history: the strength of the pulse in a model with mass loss is the same as in a model without mass loss but having the same core and envelope masses. 4. Unless extreme mass-loss rates are assumed, carbon stars are obtained in all the sequences of models with initial mass M >= 1.5 M⊙ after about 24-26 thermal pulses and 15-17 TDU episodes. At C-star formation, the core mass is less than 0.7 M⊙, and the luminosity is of the order of 104 L⊙. The dredged-up mass increases up to a maximum and then decreases as mass loss and/or the advancement of the H-burning shell consume the envelope. When the envelope mass is reduced below approximately 0.5 M⊙, TDU eventually vanishes. 5. If some amount of protons is diffused below the base of the H-rich envelope during TDU, in the interpulse a 13C-pocket is formed and then burnt radiatively via the 13C( alpha , n)16O reaction, before the onset of a new pulse. Thus, s-process nucleosynthesis occurs in a radiative environment characterized by a fairly low neutron density. In advanced thermal pulses, when the temperature at the bottom of the convective shell approaches 3 x 108 K, a secondary source of neutrons comes from the marginal activation of the 22Ne( alpha , n)25Mg reaction.},

abstract = {The nucleosynthetic origin of the rare proton-rich isotopes, usually called 'p-process' isotopes, is examined. A particularly interesting context for this synthesis is found to be explosive events characterized by peak temperatures in the range from 2 to 3 billion K. At these temperatures a series of photodisintegration reactions operating upon a distribution of r- and s-process seeds produces an abundance pattern that displays striking similarities to that of the p-process nuclei in the solar system. The large proton densities usually required for such synthesis are not needed. Requisite conditions for this model are expected to occur naturally in those zones of supernovae that have experienced helium and perhaps carbon burning prior to explosion. Implications for supernova structure, presupernova evolution, and cosmochronology are discussed, and a critical discussion of other current p-process models is presented.},

abstract = {We present a detailed kinematic analysis of the outer halo globular cluster system of the Andromeda galaxy (M31). Our basis for this is a set of new spectroscopic observations for 78 clusters lying at projected distances between Rproj {\~{ }} 20-140 kpc from the M31 centre. These are largely drawn from the recent Pan-Andromeda Archaeological Survey globular cluster catalogue; 63 of our targets have no previous velocity data. Via a Bayesian maximum likelihood analysis, we find that globular clusters with Rproj > 30 kpc exhibit coherent rotation around the minor optical axis of M31, in the same direction as more centrally located globular clusters, but with a smaller amplitude of 86 {\textpm} 17 km s-1. There is also evidence that the velocity dispersion of the outer halo globular cluster system decreases as a function of projected distance from the M31 centre, and that this relation can be well described by a power law of index $\approx$ -0.5. The velocity dispersion profile of the outer halo globular clusters is quite similar to that of the halo stars, at least out to the radius up to which there is available information on the stellar kinematics. We detect and discuss various velocity correlations amongst subgroups of globular clusters that lie on stellar debris streams in the M31 halo. Many of these subgroups are dynamically cold, exhibiting internal velocity dispersions consistent with zero. Simple Monte Carlo experiments imply that such configurations are unlikely to form by chance, adding weight to the notion that a significant fraction of the outer halo globular clusters in M31 have been accreted alongside their parent dwarf galaxies. We also estimate the M31 mass within 200 kpc via the Tracer Mass Estimator (TME), finding (1.2-1.6) {\textpm} 0.2 {\texttimes} 1012 M⊙. This quantity is subject to additional systematic effects due to various limitations of the data, and assumptions built in into the TME. Finally, we discuss our results in the context of formation scenarios for the M31 halo.},

abstract = {We have determined Li, C, N, O, Na, and Fe abundances, and 12C/13C isotopic ratios for a sample of 62 field metal-poor stars in the metallicity range -2<=[Fe/H]<= -1. Stars were selected in order to have accurate luminosity estimates from the literature, so that evolutionary phases could be clearly determined for each star. We further enlarged this dataset by adding 43 more stars having accurate abundances for some of these elements and similarly well defined luminosities from the literature. This large sample was used to show that (small mass) lower-RGB stars (i.e. stars brighter than the first dredge-up luminosity and fainter than that of the RGB bump) have abundances of light elements in agreement with predictions from classical evolutionary models: only marginal changes occur for CNO elements, while dilution within the convective envelope causes the surface Li abundance to decrease by a factor of {\textasciitilde} 20. A second, distinct mixing episode occurs in most (perhaps all) small mass metal-poor stars just after the RGB bump, when the molecular weight barrier left by the maximum inward penetration of the convective shell is canceled by the outward expansion of the H-burning shell, in agreement with recent theoretical predictions. In field stars, this second mixing episode only reaches regions of incomplete CNO burning: it causes a depletion of the surface 12C abundance by about a factor of 2.5, and a corresponding increase in the N abundance by about a factor of 4. The 12C/13C is lowered to about 6 to 10 (close to but distinctly higher than the equilibrium value of 3.5), while practically all remaining Li is burnt. However an O-Na anti-correlation such as typically observed amongst globular cluster stars, is not present in field stars. None of the 29 field stars more evolved than the RGB bump (including 8 RHB stars) shows any sign of an O depletion or Na enhancement. This means that the second mixing episode is not deep enough to reach regions were ON-burning occurs in field stars.

abstract = {The evolution of Population III stars (Z=0) is followed from the pre-main-sequence phase up to the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase for intermediate-mass stars and up to C ignition in more massive stars. Our grid includes 11 stars, covering the mass range 0.8-20 Msolar. During the H and He core burning phases an overshooting characterized by d=0.20HP was applied, and during the AGB phase a small extension of the convective envelope was also allowed, characterized by d=0.05HP. We find that at the beginning of the AGB phase, following the development of a convective instability in the He-burning shell, a secondary convective zone forms at the He-H discontinuity. This unusual convective zone then expands and overlaps with the region previously occupied by the receding He-driven instability. Carbon is engulfed and an H flash takes place as a result of the activation of the CNO cycle. Following these successive (H+He) flashes, the convective envelope penetrates deeper into the star, reaches the secondary H convective shell, and allows CNO catalysts to be dredged up to the surface. These mixing episodes, which have been found to occur in our 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, and 5 Msolar models, increase the carbon abundance in the envelope and allow low- and intermediate-mass stars to achieve a ``standard'' thermally pulsing AGB phase, confirming the recent results by Chieffi and collaborators. We also find that at the beginning of the double shell burning evolution, our 4 and 5 Msolar models experience so-called degenerate thermal pulses, which are very similar to those found by Frost et al. but absent from the Chieffi et al. simulations. Finally, in the 7 Msolar model, the CNO envelope abundance following the second dredge-up is so large that the star does not experience the carbon injection episode and follows a standard thermally pulsing AGB evolution. Our computations also indicate that, thanks to the small overshooting at the base of the convective envelope, the third dredge-up is already operating in stars with M>=1.5 Msolar after a few pulses, and that by the end of our modeling, hot bottom burning is activated in stars more massive than {\textasciitilde}2 Msolar. This evolutionary behavior suggests that primordial low- and intermediate-mass stars could have been significant contributors to the production of primary 12C and 14N and may have contributed to some extent to the production of Mg and Al and possibly s-process elements (despite the lack of iron seeds) in the early universe.},

abstract = {The stars in globular clusters are known to differ in their surface chemistry: spectroscopic investigations in recent decades outlined the presence of star-to-star differences in the abundances of the light elements, up to aluminium (and possibly silicon), suggesting that some stars were contaminated by an advanced proton-capture nucleosynthesis. The asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars are one of the most promising candidates in producing the pollution of the intracluster medium, via the ejection of gas processed by hot bottom burning, from which new stellar generations are formed. This work is focused on the degree of nucleosynthesis involving magnesium, aluminium and silicon that these sources may experience. The key ingredient in determining the degree of magnesium depletion, and the amount of aluminium that can be produced, is the rate of proton capture on 25Mg, forming 26Al; an increase in this cross-section by a factor of 2 with respect to the highest value allowed by the NACRE compilation allows the reproduction of the extent of the Mg depletion observed, and is in qualitative agreement with the positive Al-Si correlation observed in a few clusters. The main uncertainties associated with the macro- and microphysics input are discussed and commented upon, and a comparison with recent spectroscopic results for globular clusters showing some degree of Mg-Al anticorrelation and Al-Si correlation is presented.},

For a complete discussion of the branching at 85Kr, we additionally present a new measurement of the 87Rb neutron capture cross section. The reproduction of the weak component by successive stellar generations is investigated through a global check which takes into account the interference of the main component in the atomic mass range from Fe to Sr. Consequently, the results of s-processing in low-mass stars during the thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch phase are also considered, starting from the same set of revised nuclear parameters. A satisfactory match of the solar s-abundances is reached, where the problem of the 86Kr overproduction by the main component is overcome by varying the <$\sigma$n,$\gamma$> of 84,85,86Kr inside their present uncertainties, and by considering an additional contribution to <$\sigma$n,$\gamma$> (86Kr) at low temperature by direct captures or undetected resonances. A detailed analysis of the neutron flow at branchings and at bottleneck points is performed, stressing the analogies and differences between the phenomenological and astrophysical picture.},

The nucleosynthetic mechanism is characterized by a low mean neutron density, which never exceeds 10 to the 6th n/cu cm. A good production of the s-isotopes in the atomic mass range 70-90 is found, the actual neutron exposure depending on some critical parameters. Important contributions are also found for several light n-rich species and for the heavy rare isotopes Gd-152 and Ta-180. How s-processing in a typical massive star compares with predictions by classical analysis is addressed.},

We either assume that the galaxy accretes its mass through smooth infall of gas of primordial chemical composition (classical models) or adopt mass accretion histories derived from the combination of merger trees with semi-analytical modelling (cosmologically-motivated models). Furthermore, we consider models with and without taking into account inhomogeneous mixing in the interstellar medium within the galaxy, i.e. homogeneous versus inhomogeneous models. The theoretical predictions are then compared to each other and to the body of the available data. From this analysis, we confirm previous findings that Bo{\"o}tes I has formed stars with very low efficiency but, at variance with previous studies, we do not find a clear-cut indication that supernova explosions have sustained long-lasting galactic-scale outflows in this galaxy. Therefore, we suggest that external mechanisms such as ram pressure stripping and tidal stripping are needed to explain the absence of neutral gas in Bo{\"o}tes I today.},

The same stars have previously been studied by Chiappini et al., who found very high abundances of the slow neutron capture elements compared with other clusters and field stars of similar metallicity, which they interpreted as reflecting nucleosynthesis in rapidly rotating, massive Population III stars. In contrast to their analysis, we do not find any unusual enhancements of the neutron capture elements Sr, Y, Ba and Eu and conclude that previous claims result mainly from not properly accounting for blending lines. Instead, we find NGC 6522 to be an unremarkable globular cluster with comparable abundance trends to other Galactic globular clusters at the same metallicity ([Fe/H] = -1.15 {\textpm} 0.16). The stars are also chemically similar to halo and bulge field stars at the same metallicity, spanning a small range in [Y/Ba] and with normal $\alpha$-element abundances. We thus find no observational evidence for any chemical signatures of rapidly rotating Population III stars in NGC 6522.},

However, NGC 1851 also exhibits large star-to-star abundance variations of the s-process elements Zr and La. These s-process elements are correlated with Al and anticorrelated with O. Furthermore, the Zr and La abundances appear to cluster around two distinct values. A recent study revealed a double subgiant branch in NGC 1851. Our data reinforce the notion that there are two stellar populations in NGC 1851 and indicate that this cluster has experienced a complicated formation history with similarities to $\omega$ Centauri.

Dredge-up must begin earlier and extend deeper. We find this for the first time in our models of LMC metallicity. Such features are not found in our models of SMC metallicity. The fully implicit and simultaneous stellar evolution code STARS has been used to calculate the evolution of AGB stars with metallicities of Z= 0.008 and Z= 0.004, corresponding to the observed metallicities of the LMC and SMC, respectively. Third dredge-up occurs in stars of 1 Msolar and above and carbon stars were found for models between 1 Msolar and 3 Msolar. We use the detailed models as input physics for a population synthesis code and generate carbon star luminosity functions. We now find that we are able to reproduce the carbon star luminosity function of the LMC without any manipulation of our models. The SMC carbon star luminosity function still cannot be produced from our detailed models unless the minimum core mass for third dredge-up is reduced by 0.06 Msolar.},

Our calculations show the 3^rd^ dredge-up already at the 7^th^ thermal pulse (TP), and the dredge-up parameter reaches $\lambda$=0.6 during the next five pulses. Accordingly, the amount of dredged up ^12^C is up to 10^-3^Msun_. Our models develope a small so-called ^13^C-pocket consisting of a few 10^-7^ Msun_. Finally, this treatment of boundaries of convective regions leads to intershell abundances of typically (^4^He/^12^C/^16^O)=(23/50/25) (compared to (70/26/1) in the standard treatment).},

abstract = {Recent observational studies have revealed star-to-star abundance inhomogeneity among light elements (e.g. C, N, O, Na and Al) of stars on the main sequence in the Galactic globular clusters (GCs). One of the promising interpretations for this result is that the observed abundance inhomogeneity is due to the second generation of stars formed from ejecta of the first generation of evolved stars (e.g. asymptotic giant branch stars) within GCs. However, it remains unclear whether and how this primordial pollution can occur within GCs. We here propose a new scenario in which primordial pollution of GCs is highly likely to occur if GCs are located in the central regions of high-redshift dark matter subhaloes that can host low-mass dwarf galaxies. In this scenario, gas ejected from the first generation of stars of GCs can be effectively trapped in the deep gravitational potential of their host haloes, and consequently can be consumed for the formation of the second generation of stars without losing a significant amount of gas by ram pressure stripping of interstellar and intergalactic medium. During merging of these haloes with the proto-Galaxy, the haloes are completely destroyed owing to the strong tidal field of the Galaxy. The self-polluted GCs located initially in the central regions of the haloes can survive tidal destruction owing to their compactness and finally become the Galactic halo GCs. In this scenario, ejecta of field stars surrounding the central GCs can be also converted into stars within their host dwarfs and finally become the second generation of stars of GCs. We also discuss the origin of the difference in the degree of abundance inhomogeneity between different GCs, such as $\omega$ Centauri and NGC 6752, in terms of the difference in physical properties between host haloes from which GCs originate.},

The data are compared with those of the database available thanks to the IRAS, Infrared Space Observatory, Midcourse Space Experiment, and Two Micron All Sky Survey catalogs. Our goal is to establish relations between the IR colors, the effective temperature Teff, the luminosity L, and the mass-loss rate M{\.{ }}, for improving the effectiveness of AGB modeling. Bolometric (absolute) magnitudes are obtained through distance compilations and by applying previously derived bolometric corrections; the variability is also studied, using data accumulated since the IRAS epoch. The main results are as follows: (1) Values of L and M{\.{ }} for C stars fit relations previously established by us, with Mira variables being on average more evolved and mass-losing than semiregular variables. (2) Moderate IR excesses (as compared to evolutionary tracks) are found for S and M stars in our sample: they are confirmed to originate from the dusty circumstellar environment. (3) A larger reddening characterizes C-rich Mira variables and post-AGB stars. In this case, part of the excess is due to AGB models overestimating Teff for C stars, as a consequence of the lack of suitable molecular opacities. This has a large effect on the colors of C-rich sources, and sometimes disentangling the photospheric and circumstellar contributions is difficult; better model atmospheres should be used in stellar evolutionary codes for C stars. (4) The presence of a long-term variability at mid-IR wavelengths seems to be limited to sources with maximum emission in the 8-20 $\mu$m region, usually Mira variables (one-third of our sample). Most of the semiregular and post-AGB stars studied here have remained remarkably constant in the mid-IR over the last 20 years.},

abstract = {The majority of globular clusters show chemical inhomogeneities in the composition of their stars, apparently due to a second stellar generation in which the forming gas is enriched by hot-CNO cycled material processed in stars belonging to a first stellar generation. Clearly this evidence prompts questions on the modalities of formation of globular clusters. An important preliminary input to any model for the formation of multiple generations is to determine which is today the relative number fraction of `normal' and anomalous stars in each cluster. As it is very difficult to gather very large spectroscopic samples of globular cluster stars to achieve this result with good statistical significance, we propose to use the horizontal branch (HB). We assume that, whichever the progenitors of the second generation, the anomalies also include enhanced helium abundance. In fact, helium variations have been recently recognized to be able to explain several puzzling peculiarities (gaps, RRLyr periods and period distribution, ratio of blue to red stars, blue tails) in HBs. We summarize previous results and extend the analysis in order to infer the percentage in number of the first and second generation in as many clusters as possible. We show that, with few exceptions, approximately 50 per cent or more of the stars belong to the second generation. In other cases, in which at first sight one would think of a simple stellar population, we give arguments and suggest that the stars might all belong to the second generation. We provide in the appendix a detailed discussion and new fits of the optical and ultraviolet data of NGC2808, the classic example of a multiple helium populations cluster, consistently including a reproduction of the main-sequence splittings and an examination of the problem of `blue hook' stars. We also show a detailed fit of the totally blue HB of M13, one among the clusters that are possibly fully made up by second generation stars. We conclude that the formation of the second generation is a crucial event in the life of globular clusters. The problem of the initial mass function required to achieve the observed high fraction of second generation stars can be solved only if the initial cluster was much more massive than the present one and most of the first generation low-mass stars have been preferentially lost. As shown by D'Ercole et al., by modelling the formation and dynamical evolution of the second generation, the mass loss due to the explosions of the Type II supernovae of the first generation may be the process responsible for triggering the expansion of the cluster, the stripping of its outer layers and the loss of most of the first generation low-mass stars.

abstract = {The horizontal branch (HB) morphology of globular clusters (GCs) is most strongly influenced by metallicity. The second parameter phenomenon, first described in the 1960s, acknowledges that metallicity alone is not enough to describe the HB morphology of all GCs. In particular, astronomers noticed that the outer Galactic halo contains GCs with redder HBs at a given metallicity than are found inside the solar circle. Thus, at least a second parameter was required to characterize HB morphology. While the term "second parameter" has since come to be used in a broader context, its identity with respect to the original problem has not been conclusively determined. Here we analyze the median color difference between the HB and the red giant branch, hereafter denoted as $\Delta$(V - I), measured from Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) photometry of 60 GCs within {\textasciitilde}20 kpc of the Galactic center. Analysis of this homogeneous data set reveals that, after the influence of metallicity has been removed from the data, the correlation between $\Delta$(V - I) and age is stronger than that of any other parameter considered. Expanding the sample to include HST ACS and Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 photometry of the six most distant Galactic GCs lends additional support to the correlation between $\Delta$(V - I) and age. This result is robust with respect to the adopted metallicity scale and the method of age determination, but must bear the caveat that high-quality, detailed abundance information is not available for a significant fraction of the sample. Furthermore, when a subset of GCs with similar metallicities and ages is considered, a correlation between $\Delta$(V - I) and central luminosity density is exposed. With respect to the existence of GCs with anomalously red HBs at a given metallicity, we conclude that age is the second parameter and central density is most likely the third. Important problems related to HB morphology in GCs, notably multi-modal distributions and faint blue tails, remain to be explained.

abstract = {We study the s-process abundances (A >{\textasciitilde} 90) at the epoch of the solar system formation. Asymptotic giant branch yields are computed with an updated neutron capture network and updated initial solar abundances. We confirm our previous results obtained with a Galactic chemical evolution (GCE) model: (1) as suggested by the s-process spread observed in disk stars and in presolar meteoritic SiC grains, a weighted average of s-process strengths is needed to reproduce the solar s distribution of isotopes with A > 130; and (2) an additional contribution (of about 25%) is required in order to represent the solar s-process abundances of isotopes from A = 90 to 130. Furthermore, we investigate the effect of different internal structures of the 13C pocket, which may affect the efficiency of the 13C($\alpha$, n)16O reaction, the major neutron source of the s process. First, keeping the same 13C profile adopted so far, we modify by a factor of two the mass involved in the pocket; second, we assume a flat 13C profile in the pocket, and we test again the effects of the variation of the mass of the pocket. We find that GCE s predictions at the epoch of the solar system formation marginally depend on the size and shape of the 13C pocket once a different weighted range of 13C-pocket strengths is assumed. We obtain that, independently of the internal structure of the 13C pocket, the missing solar system s-process contribution in the range from A = 90 to 130 remains essentially the same.},

abstract = {We report a comprehensive light-element (Li, C, N, O, Na, Mg, and Al) abundance analysis of three solar-type main sequence (MS) dwarfs and three red giant branch (RGB) clump stars in the Hyades open cluster using high-resolution and high signal-to-noise spectroscopy. The abundances have been derived in a self-consistent fashion, and for each group (MS or RGB), the CNO abundances are found to be in excellent star-to-star agreement. Using the dwarfs to infer the initial composition of the giants, the combined abundance patterns confirm that the giants have undergone the first dredge-up and that material processed by the CN cycle has been mixed to the surface layers. The observed abundances are compared to predictions of a standard stellar model based on the Clemson-American University of Beirut (CAUB) stellar evolution code. The model reproduces the observed evolution of the N and O abundances, as well as the previously derived 12C/13C ratio, but it fails to predict by a factor of 1.5 the observed level of 12C depletion. A similar discord appears to exist in previously reported observed and modeled C abundances of giants in the Galactic disk. Random uncertainties in the mean abundances and uncertainties related to possible systematic errors in the Hyades dwarf and giant parameter scales cannot account for the discrepancy in the observed and modeled abundances. Li abundances are derived to determine if noncanonical extra mixing, like that seen in low-mass metal-poor giants, has occurred in the Hyades giants. The Li abundance of the giant $\gamma$ Tau is in good accord with the predicted level of surface Li dilution, but a {\textasciitilde}0.35 dex spread in the giant Li abundances is found and cannot be explained by the stellar model. Possible sources of the spread are discussed; however, it is apparent that the differential mechanism responsible for the Li dispersion must be unrelated to the uniformly low 12C abundances of the giants. Na, Mg, and Al abundances are derived as an additional test of our stellar model. All three elements are found to be overabundant by 0.2-0.5 dex in the giants relative to the dwarfs. Such large enhancements of these elements are not predicted by the stellar model, and non-LTE effects significantly larger (and, in some cases, of opposite sign) than those implied by extant literature calculations are the most likely cause.

abstract = {It was found that even for stars evolved away from the red giant branch, a new mixing of nucleosynthesis products from the hydrogenand helium-burning shells into surface layers was possible, from the penetration of the contaminated intershell region into the H- and He-ionization convection zones. This is due to the helium shell flash driving an immense expansion of an inner carbon pocket, namely, by a factor of 12,000 in radius, a drop in density of about 10 to the 12th, and a cooling of inner pockets normally near 10 to the 8th K to 23,000 K. The surface would be enriched in carbon (C-12), helium (He-4) and s-process elements, but not significantly in nitrogen (N-14), oxygen (O-16), or the isotope C-13. This new type of mixing might provide the missing clue for FG Sagittae. Such a mixing has been suggested by the observations of FG Sagittae, but had been unexplainable by theory up to now.},

abstract = {In recent years the view of Galactic globular clusters as simple stellar populations has changed dramatically, it is now thought that basically all globular clusters host multiple stellar populations, each with its own chemical abundance pattern and colour-magnitude diagram sequence. Recent spectroscopic observations of asymptotic giant branch stars in the globular cluster NGC 6752 have disclosed a low [Na/Fe] abundance for the whole sample, suggesting that they are all first generation stars, and that all second generation stars fail to reach the AGB in this cluster. A scenario proposed to explain these observations invokes strong mass loss in second generation horizontal branch stars - all located at the hot side of the blue and extended horizontal branch of this cluster - possibly induced by the metal enhancement associated to radiative levitation. This enhanced mass loss would prevent second generation stars from reaching the asymptotic giant branch phase, thus explaining at the same time the low value of the ratio between horizontal branch and asymptotic giant branch stars (the R2 parameter) observed in NGC 6752. We have critically discussed this mass-loss scenario, finding that the required mass-loss rates are of the order of 10-9 M⊙ yr-1, significantly higher than current theoretical and empirical constraints. By making use of synthetic horizontal branch simulations, we demonstrate that our modelling correctly predicts the R2 parameter for NGC 6752, without the need to invoke very efficient mass loss during the core He-burning stage. As a test of our stellar models we show that we can reproduce the observed value of R2 for both M 3, a cluster of approximately the same metallicity and with a redder horizontal branch morphology, and M 13, a cluster with a horizontal branch very similar to NGC 6752. However, our simulations for the NGC 6752 horizontal branch predict however the presence of a significant fraction of second generation stars (about 50%) along the cluster asymptotic giant branch. We conclude that there is no simple explanation for the lack of second generation stars in the spectroscopically surveyed sample, although the interplay between mass loss (with low rates) and radiative levitation may play a role in explaining this puzzle.},

abstract = {We present the SuperNova Explosion Code SNEC, an open-source Lagrangian code for the hydrodynamics and equilibrium-diffusion radiation transport in the expanding envelopes of supernovae. Given a model of a progenitor star, an explosion energy, and an amount and distribution of radioactive nickel, SNEC generates the bolometric light curve, as well as the light curves in different wavelength bands assuming black body emission. As a first application of SNEC, we consider the explosions of a grid of 15 Msun (at zero-age main sequence) stars whose hydrogen envelopes are stripped to different extents and at different points in their evolution. The resulting light curves exhibit plateaus with durations of {\textasciitilde}20-100 days if >{\textasciitilde}1.5-2 Msun of hydrogen-rich material is left and no plateau if less hydrogen-rich material is left. The shorter plateau lengths are unlike the Type IIP supernova light curves typically observed in nature. This suggests that, at least for zero-age main sequence masses <{\textasciitilde} 20 Msun, hydrogen mass loss occurs as an all or nothing process, perhaps pointing to the important role binary interactions play in observed mass-stripped supernovae (i.e., Type Ib/c events). These light curves are also unlike what is typically seen for Type IIL supernovae, arguing that simply varying the amount of mass loss cannot explain these events. The most stripped models begin to show double-peaked light curves similar to what is often seen for Type IIb supernovae, confirming previous work that these supernovae can come from progenitors that have a small amount of hydrogen and a radius of {\textasciitilde}500 Rsun.},

abstract = {We present a new code for solving the molecular and atomic excitation and radiation transfer problem in a molecular gas and predicting emergent spectra. This code works in arbitrary three dimensional geometry using unstructured Delaunay latices for the transport of photons. Various physical models can be used as input, ranging from analytical descriptions over tabulated models to SPH simulations. To generate the Delaunay grid we sample the input model randomly, but weigh the sample probability with the molecular density and other parameters, and thereby we obtain an average grid point separation that scales with the local opacity. Our code does photon very efficiently so that the slow convergence of opaque models becomes traceable. When convergence between the level populations, the radiation field, and the point separation has been obtained, the grid is ray-traced to produced images that can readily be compared to observations. Because of the high dynamic range in scales that can be resolved using this type of grid, our code is particularly well suited for modeling of ALMA data. Our code can furthermore deal with overlapping lines of multiple molecular and atomic species.},

abstract = {Type I planetary nebulae (PNe) have high He/H and N/O ratios and are thought to be descendants of stars with initial masses of {\textasciitilde}3-8 M sun. These characteristics indicate that the progenitor stars experienced proton-capture nucleosynthesis at the base of the convective envelope, in addition to the slow neutron capture process operating in the He-shell (the s-process). We compare the predicted abundances of elements up to Sr from models of intermediate-mass asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars to measured abundances in Type I PNe. In particular, we compare predictions and observations for the light trans-iron elements Se and Kr, in order to constrain convective mixing and the s-process in these stars. A partial mixing zone is included in selected models to explore the effect of a 13C pocket on the s-process yields. The solar-metallicity models produce enrichments of [(Se, Kr)/Fe] lsim0.6, consistent with Galactic Type I PNe where the observed enhancements are typically lsim0.3 dex, while lower metallicity models predict larger enrichments of C, N, Se, and Kr. O destruction occurs in the most massive models but it is not efficient enough to account for the gsim0.3 dex O depletions observed in some Type I PNe. It is not possible to reach firm conclusions regarding the neutron source operating in massive AGB stars from Se and Kr abundances in Type I PNe; abundances for more s-process elements may help to distinguish between the two neutron sources. We predict that only the most massive (M gsim 5 M sun) models would evolve into Type I PNe, indicating that extra-mixing processes are active in lower-mass stars (3-4 M sun), if these stars are to evolve into Type I PNe.

These stars have precise atmospheric parameters measured by Nissen and Schuster, who find that they separate into three groups based on their kinematics and $\alpha$-element (Mg, Si, Ca, Ti) abundances: thick disk, high-$\alpha$ halo, and low-$\alpha$ halo. We find the oxygen abundance trends of thick-disk and high-$\alpha$ halo stars very similar. The low-$\alpha$ stars show a larger star-to-star scatter in [O/Fe] at a given [Fe/H] and have systematically lower oxygen abundances compared to the other two groups. Thus, we find the behavior of oxygen abundances in these groups of stars similar to that of the $\alpha$ elements. We use previously published oxygen abundance data of disk and very metal-poor halo stars to present an overall view (-2.3 < [Fe/H] < +0.3) of oxygen abundance trends of stars in the solar neighborhood. Two field halo dwarf stars stand out in their O and Na abundances. Both G53-41 and G150-40 have very low oxygen and very high sodium abundances, which are key signatures of the abundance anomalies observed in globular cluster (GC) stars. Therefore, they are likely field halo stars born in GCs. If true, we estimate that at least 3% {\textpm} 2% of the local field metal-poor star population was born in GCs.},

abstract = {Context: Mass loss is one of the fundamental properties of Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars, and through the enrichment of the interstellar medium, AGB stars are key players in the life cycle of dust and gas in the universe. However, a quantitative understanding of the mass-loss process is still largely lacking, particularly its dependence on metallicity. Aims: To investigate the relation between mass loss, luminosity and pulsation period for a large sample of evolved stars in the Small and Large Magellanic Cloud. Methods: Dust radiative transfer models are presented for 101 carbon stars and 86 oxygen-rich evolved stars in the Magellanic Clouds for which 5-35 $\mu$m Spitzer IRS spectra are available. The spectra are complemented with available optical and infrared photometry to construct the spectral energy distribution. A minimisation procedure is used to fit luminosity, mass-loss rate and dust temperature at the inner radius. Different effective temperatures and dust content are also considered. Periods from the literature and from new OGLE-III data are compiled and derived. Results: We derive (dust) mass-loss rates and luminosities for the entire sample. Based on luminosities, periods and amplitudes and colours, the O-rich stars are classified as foreground objects, AGB stars and Red Super Giants. For the O-rich stars silicates based on laboratory optical constants are compared to {\textquotedblleft}astronomical silicates{\textquotedblright}. Overall, the grain type by Volk {\&} Kwok (1988, ApJ, 331, 435) fits the data best. However, the fit based on laboratory optical constants for the grains can be improved by abandoning the small-particle limit. The influence of grain size, core-mantle grains and porosity are explored. A computationally convenient method that seems to describe the observed properties in the 10 $\mu$m window are a distribution of hollow spheres with a large vacuum fraction (typically 70%), and grain size of about 1 $\mu$m. Relations between mass-loss rates and luminosity and pulsation period are presented and compared to the predictions of evolutionary models, those by Vassiliadis {\&} Wood (1993, ApJ, 413, 641) and their adopted mass-loss recipe, and those based on a Reimers mass-loss law with a scaling of a factor of five. The Vassiliadis {\&} Wood models describe the data better, although there are also some deficiencies, in particular to the maximum adopted mass-loss rate. The derived mass-loss rates are compared to predictions by dynamical wind models and appear consistent with them at a level of a factor 2-4. A better understanding requires the determination of the expansion velocity from future observations from ALMA. The OGLE-III data reveal an O-rich star in the SMC with a period of 1749 days. Its absolute magnitude of M_bol= -8.0 makes it a good candidate for a super-AGB star.

Single star nucleosynthesis is fitted directly to full evolution models and our model includes first, second and third dredge-ups with s-process enhancements, an analytic calculation for hot-bottom burning of CNO, NeNa and MgAl isotopes, surface enhancements due to wind loss in massive stars and core-collapse supernova yields. Even though this algorithm operates about 107 times faster than full evolution and nucleosynthesis calculations, agreement with such models is good. We extend the single star model to include prescriptions of binary star interactions, notably mass loss and gain by stellar winds and Roche-lobe overflow, novae and type Ia supernovae.

The variations of carbon, nitrogen, and/or strontium show several different abundance patterns as a function of [Fe/H]. The source of the enhancements/depletions in carbon, nitrogen, and/or strontium may be enrichment from asymptotic giant branch stars of low (1-3 Msolar) and intermediate (3-8 Msolar) mass. Massive rotating stars that produce excess nitrogen without carbon and oxygen overabundances may also play a role. These abundances enable different contributors to be considered and incorporated into the evolutionary picture of $\omega$ Cen.},

abstract = {Aims: The initial cluster mass function (ICMF) in spiral discs is constrained and compared with data for old globular clusters and young clusters in starbursts. Methods: For a given absolute magnitude, the cluster age distribution depends on the ICMF. Here, the behaviour of the median age-magnitude relation is analysed in detail for Schechter ICMFs with various cut-off masses, M_c. The calculated relations are compared with observations of the brightest clusters in spiral galaxies. Schechter functions are also fitted directly to observed mass functions (MFs). Results: A single Schechter ICMF with an Mc of a few times 105 M⊙ can reproduce the observed ages and luminosities of the brightest (and 5th brightest) clusters in the spirals if disruption of optically visible clusters is dominated by relatively slow secular evolution. A Schechter function fit to the combined cluster MF for all spirals in the sample yields Mc = (2.1{\textpm}0.4){\texttimes}105 M⊙. The MFs in cluster-poor and cluster-rich spirals are statistically indistinguishable. An Mc = 2.1{\texttimes}105 M⊙ Schechter function also fits the MF of young clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud. If the same ICMF applies in the Milky Way, a bound cluster with M > 105 M⊙ will form about once every 107 years, while an M > 106 M⊙ cluster will form only once every 50 Gyr. Luminosity functions (LFs) of model cluster populations drawn from an Mc = 2.1{\texttimes}105 M⊙ Schechter ICMF generally agree with LFs observed in spiral galaxies. Conclusions: The ICMF in present-day spiral discs can be modelled as a Schechter function with Mc $\approx$ 2{\texttimes}105 M⊙. However, the presence of significant numbers of M > 106 M⊙ (and even M > 107 M⊙) clusters in some starburst galaxies makes it unlikely that the Mc value derived for spirals is universal. In high-pressure environments, such as those created by complex gas kinematics and feedback in mergers, Mc can shift to higher masses than in quiescent discs.},

abstract = {The stellar mass range 8 <{\textasciitilde} M/M {\&}{\#}9737; <{\textasciitilde} 12 corresponds to the most massive asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars and the most numerous massive stars. It is host to a variety of supernova (SN) progenitors and is therefore very important for galactic chemical evolution and stellar population studies. In this paper, we study the transition from super-AGB (SAGB) star to massive star and find that a propagating neon-oxygen-burning shell is common to both the most massive electron capture supernova (EC-SN) progenitors and the lowest mass iron-core-collapse supernova (FeCCSN) progenitors. Of the models that ignite neon-burning off-center, the 9.5 M {\&}{\#}9737; star would evolve to an FeCCSN after the neon-burning shell propagates to the center, as in previous studies. The neon-burning shell in the 8.8 M {\&}{\#}9737; model, however, fails to reach the center as the URCA process and an extended (0.6 M {\&}{\#}9737;) region of low Y e (0.48) in the outer part of the core begin to dominate the late evolution; the model evolves to an EC-SN. This is the first study to follow the most massive EC-SN progenitors to collapse, representing an evolutionary path to EC-SN in addition to that from SAGB stars undergoing thermal pulses (TPs). We also present models of an 8.75 M {\&}{\#}9737; SAGB star through its entire TP phase until electron captures on 20Ne begin at its center and of a 12 M {\&}{\#}9737; star up to the iron core collapse. We discuss key uncertainties and how the different pathways to collapse affect the pre-SN structure. Finally, we compare our results to the observed neutron star mass distribution.},

abstract = {Current cosmological models indicate that the Milky Way's stellar halo was assembled from many smaller systems. On the basis of the apparent absence of the most metal-poor stars in present-day dwarf galaxies, recent studies claimed that the true Galactic building blocks must have been vastly different from the surviving dwarfs. The discovery of an extremely iron-poor star (S1020549) in the Sculptor dwarf galaxy based on a medium-resolution spectrum cast some doubt on this conclusion. Verification of the iron-deficiency, however, and measurements of additional elements, such as the $\alpha$-element Mg, are necessary to demonstrate that the same type of stars produced the metals found in dwarf galaxies and the Galactic halo. Only then can dwarf galaxy stars be conclusively linked to early stellar halo assembly. Here we report high-resolution spectroscopic abundances for 11 elements in S1020549, confirming its iron abundance of less than 1/4,000th that of the Sun, and showing that the overall abundance pattern follows that seen in low-metallicity halo stars, including the $\alpha$-elements. Such chemical similarity indicates that the systems destroyed to form the halo billions of years ago were not fundamentally different from the progenitors of present-day dwarfs, and suggests that the early chemical enrichment of all galaxies may be nearly identical.},

abstract = {Despite the efforts of the past decade, the origin of the bimodal horizontal branch (HB) found in some globular clusters (GCs) remains a conundrum. Inspired by the discovery of multiple stellar populations in the most massive Galactic GC, $\omega$ Centauri, we investigate the possibility that two distinct populations may coexist and are responsible for the bimodal HBs in the third and fifth brightest GCs, NGC 6388 and NGC 6441. Using the population synthesis technique, we examine two different chemical ``self-enrichment'' hypotheses in which a primordial GC was sufficiently massive to contain two or more distinct populations as suggested by the populations found in $\omega$ Cen: (1) the age-metallicity relation scenario in which two populations with different metallicity and age coexist, following an internal age-metallicity relation, and (2) the super-helium-rich scenario in which GCs contain a certain fraction of helium-enhanced stars, for instance, the second-generation stars formed from the helium-enriched ejecta of the first. The comparative study indicates that the detailed color-magnitude diagram morphologies and the properties of the RR Lyrae variables in NGC 6388 and NGC 6441 support the latter scenario: i.e., the model which assumes a minor fraction ({\textasciitilde}15%) of helium excess (Y{\textasciitilde}=0.3) stars. The results suggest that helium content is the main driver behind the HB bimodality found most often in massive GCs. If confirmed, the GC-to-GC variation of helium abundance should be considered a local effect, further supporting the argument that age is the global second parameter of HB morphology.},

Unlike flux-limited diffusion, the method is polychromatic, includes scattering, and is able to treat the optically-thick and free-streaming regimes simultaneously. The algorithm is tested on a variety of 1D and 2D problems, and good agreement with benchmark solutions is found. The method is used to calculate the time-varying spectral energy distribution from a circumstellar disc illuminated by a protostar whose accretion luminosity is varying. It is shown that the time-lag between the optical variability and the infrared variability results from a combination of the photon traveltime and the thermal response in the disc, and that the lag is an approximately linear function of wavelength.},

abstract = {We analyze the s-process nucleosynthesis in models of rotating AGB stars, using a complete nuclear network covering nuclei up to Polonium. During the stage of thermal pulses, the extreme shear field that develops at the base of the convective envelope leads to the injection of protons into the adjacent 12C-rich core. Subsequent proton captures lead to overlapping 14N-rich and 13C-rich layers. While the 13C nuclei release neutrons due to $\alpha$- captures during the interpulse phase, the persistence of mixing due to differential rotation produces a contamination of the whole 13C-rich layer with 14N. The result is a quenching of the s-process efficiency. Our study emphasizes the sensitivity of the s-process nucleosynthesis to the strength and duration of the shear mixing phase. Uncertainties in the rate of 13C($\alpha$,n) turn out to have small effects on the resultant distribution of s-elements. Finally, we show that in this framework, a deeper third dredge-up tends to further inhibit the production of s-elements.},

We find that the thermal stability of shell sources depends on exactly three factors: they are more stable when they are geometrically thicker, less degenerate and hotter. This confirms and unifies previously obtained results in terms of the geometry, temperature and density of the shell source, by a simplified but quantitative approach to the physics of shell nuclear burning. We present instability diagrams in the temperature-density plane for hydrogen and helium shell burning, which allow a simple evaluation of the stability conditions of such shell sources in stellar models. The performance of our stability criterion is demonstrated in various numerical models: in a 3 M⊙ AGB star, in helium accreting CO white dwarfs, in a helium white dwarf which is covered by a thin hydrogen envelope, and in a 1.0 M⊙ giant.},

We determine which stars undergo an episode of flash-driven mixing, where protons are ingested into the intershell convection zone, as they enter the thermally pulsing AGB phase and which undergo third dredge-up. We find that flash-driven mixing does not occur above a metallicity of Z = 10-5 for any mass of star and that stars above 2Msolar do not experience this phenomenon at any metallicity. We find carbon ingestion (CI), the mixing of carbon into the tail of hydrogen-burning region, occurs in the mass range 2Msolar to around 4Msolar. We suggest that CI may be a weak version of the flash-driven mechanism. We also investigate the effects of convective overshooting on the behaviour of these objects. Our models struggle to explain the frequency of Carbon-Enhanced Metal-Poor (CEMP) stars that have both significant carbon and nitrogen enhancement. Carbon can be enhanced through flash-driven mixing, CI or just third dredge-up. Nitrogen can be enhanced through hot bottom burning and the occurrence of hot dredge-up also converts carbon into nitrogen. The C/N ratio may be a good indicator of the mass of the primary AGB stars.},

abstract = {Context: Precise measurements of the surface abundances of extremely low-metallicity stars have recently been obtained, and they provide new constraints for the stellar evolution models. Aims: Stellar evolution models were computed in order to explain the surface abundances observed, in particular of nitrogen. Methods: Two series of models were computed. The first series consists of 20 M_⊙ models with varying initial metallicity (Z=0.02 down to Z=10-8) and rotation (\upsilonini=0-600 km s-1). The second one consists of models with an initial metallicity of Z=10-8, masses between 9 and 85 M_⊙, and fast initial rotation velocities (\upsilonini=600-800 km s-1). Results: The most interesting models are those with Z=10-8 ([ Fe/H]{\~{ }}-6.6). In the course of helium burning, carbon and oxygen are mixed into the hydrogen-burning shell. This boosts the importance of the shell and causes a reduction of the CO core mass. Later in the evolution, the hydrogen shell deepens and produces a large amount of primary nitrogen. For the most massive models (M⪆ 60 M_⊙), significant mass loss occurs during the red supergiant stage. This mass loss is due to the surface enrichment in CNO elements via rotational and convective mixing. The 85 M_⊙ model ends up as a WO-type Wolf-Rayet star. Therefore the models predict SNe of type Ic and possibly long and soft GRBs at very low metallicities. The rotating 20 M_⊙ models can best reproduce the observed CNO abundances at the surface of extremely metal-poor (EMP) stars and the metallicity trends when their angular momentum content is the same as at solar metallicity (and therefore have an increasing surface velocity with decreasing metallicity). The wind of the massive-star models can reproduce the CNO abundances of the most metal-poor carbon-rich star known to date, HE1327-2326.},

abstract = {Globular clusters display significant variations in their light-element content, pointing to the existence of a second stellar generation formed from the ejecta of an earlier generation. The nature of these internal polluters is still a matter of debate: the two most popular scenarios indicate intermediate-mass asymptotic giant branch (IM-AGB) stars and fast rotating massive stars. Abundances determination for some key elements can help distinguish between these competitor candidates. We present in this paper Y abundances for a sample of 103 red giant branch stars in NGC 6121. Within measurement errors, we find that the [Y/Fe] is constant in this cluster contrary to a recent suggestion. For a subsample of six stars we also find [Rb/Fe] to be constant, consistent with previous studies showing no variation in other s-process elements. We also present a new set of stellar yields for IM-AGB stellar models of 5 and 6 M⊙, including heavy element s-process abundances. The uncertainties on the mass-loss rate, the mixing length parameter and the nuclear reaction rates have a major impact on the stellar abundances. Within the IM-AGB pollution scenario, the constant abundance of heavy elements inside the cluster requires a marginal s-process efficiency in IM-AGB stars. Such a constrain could still be satisfied by the present models assuming a stronger mass-loss rate. The uncertainties mentioned above are limiting the predictive power of IM-AGB models. For these reasons, at the moment we are not able to clearly rule out their role as main polluters of the second population stars in globular clusters.},

We compare the consistency of electron temperatures measured from the [O III] $\lambda$4363, [N II] $\lambda$5755, [S III] $\lambda$6312, and [O II] $\lambda$7325 auroral lines. Temperatures from [O III], [S III], and [N II] are correlated with relative offsets that are consistent with expectations from nebular photoionization models. However, the temperatures derived from the [O II] $\lambda$7325 line show a large scatter and are nearly uncorrelated with temperatures derived from other ions. We tentatively attribute this result to observational and physical effects, which may introduce large random and systematic errors into abundances derived solely from [O II] temperatures. Our derived oxygen abundances are well fitted by an exponential distribution over six disk scale lengths, from approximately 1.3 (O/H)solar in the center to 1/15 (O/H)solar in the outermost region studied [for solar 12+log(O/H)=8.7]. We measure significant radial gradients in N/O and He/H abundance ratios, but relatively constant S/O and Ar/O. Our results are in approximate agreement with previously published abundances studies of M101 based on temperature measurements of a few H II regions. However, our abundances are systematically lower by 0.2-0.5 dex than those derived from the most widely used strong-line ``empirical'' abundance indicators, again consistent with previous studies based on smaller H II region samples. Independent measurements of the Galactic interstellar oxygen abundance from ultraviolet absorption lines are in good agreement with the Te-based nebular abundances. We suspect that most of the disagreement with the strong-line abundances arises from uncertainties in the nebular models that are used to calibrate the ``empirical'' scale, and that strong-line abundances derived for H II regions and emission-line galaxies are as much as a factor of 2 higher than the actual oxygen abundances. However, other explanations, such as the effects of temperature fluctuations on the auroral line based abundances, cannot be completely ruled out. These results point to the need for direct abundance determinations of a larger sample of extragalactic H II regions, especially for objects more metal-rich than solar.},

We found that delaying the superwind in solar metallicity massive AGB stars results in a larger production of s-process elements, something that would be also expected at lower metallicities. These new models and the available observations show that massive C-O core AGB stars in our Galaxy and in the Magellanic Clouds experience considerable third dredge-up (TDU). Thus, if massive AGB stars at the metallicities of the globular clusters (GCs) also experience deep TDU, then these stars would not be good candidates to explain the abundance anomalies observed in most GCs. However, more massive AGB stars (e.g., near the limit of C-O core production) or super-AGB stars with O-Ne cores may not experience very efficient TDU, producing the high He abundances needed to explain the multiple populations observed in some GCs.},

abstract = {This article addresses three of the four nucleosynthesis processes involved in producing heavy nuclei beyond Fe (with a main focus on the r-process). Opposite to the fourth process (the s-process), which operates in stellar evolution during He- and C-burning, they are all related to explosive burning phases, (presumably) linked to core collapse supernova events of massive stars. The (classical) p-process is identified with explosive Ne/O-burning in outer zones of the progenitor star. It is initiated by the passage of the supernova shock wave and acts via photodisintegration reactions like a spallation process which produces neighboring (proton-rich) isotopes from pre-existing heavy nuclei. The reproduction of some of the so-called lighter p-isotopes with A<100 faces problems in this environment. The only recently discovered $\nu$p-process is related to the innermost ejecta, the neutrino wind expelled from the hot proto-neutron star after core collapse and the supernova explosion. This neutrino wind is proton-rich in its early phase, producing nuclei up to 64Ge. Reactions with neutrinos permit to overcome decay/reaction bottlenecks for the flow beyond 64Ge, thus producing light p-isotopes, which face problems in the classical p-process scenario. The understanding of the r-process, being identified for a long time with rapid neutron captures and passing through nuclei far from stability, is still experiencing major problems. These are on the one hand related to nuclear uncertainties far from stability (masses, half-lives, fission barriers), affecting the process speed and abundance peaks. On the other hand the site is still not definitely located, yet. (i) Later, possibly neutron-rich, high entropy phases of the neutrino wind (if they materialize!) could permit its operation. (ii) Other options include the ejection of very neutron-rich neutron star-like matter, occurring possibly in neutron star mergers or core collapse supernova events with jets, related to prior stellar evolution with high rotation rates and magnetic fields. Two different environments are required for a weak and a main/strong r-process, witnessed by observations of low metallicity stars and meteoritic inclusions, which could possibly be identified with the two options listed above, i.e. the weak r-process could be related to the neutrino wind when changing from p-rich to n-rich conditions.},

abstract = {Recent spectroscopic measurements in open clusters younger than the Sun with [Fe/H] gsim 0 showed that the abundances of neutron-rich elements have continued to increase in the Galaxy after the formation of the Sun, roughly maintaining a solar-like distribution. This growth requires neutron fluences larger than those so far assumed, as these would have too few neutrons per iron seed. We suggest that the observed enhancements can be produced by nucleosynthesis in asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars of low mass (M < 1.5 M ⊙) if they release neutrons from the 13C($\alpha$,n)16O reaction in reservoirs larger by a factor of four than assumed in more massive AGB stars (M > 1.5 M ⊙). Adopting such a stronger neutron source as a contributor to the abundances at the time of formation of the Sun, we show that this also affects the solar s-process distribution, so that its main component is well reproduced, without the need to assume ad hoc primary sources for the synthesis of s elements up to A {\textasciitilde} 130, contrary to suggestions from other works. The changes in the expected abundances that we find are primarily due to the following reasons. (1) Enhancing the neutron source increases the efficiency of the s process, so that the ensuing stellar yields now mimic the solar distribution at a metallicity higher than before ([Fe/H ] gsim -0.1). (2) The age-metallicity relation is rather flat for several Gyr in that metallicity regime, so that those conditions remain stable and the enhanced nuclear yields, which are necessary to maintain a solar-like abundance pattern, can dominate the composition of the interstellar medium from which subsequent stars are formed.},

abstract = {Here we consider the strong evolution experienced by the matter reinserted by massive stars, both in giant star-forming regions driven by a constant star formation rate and in massive and coeval superstar clusters. In both cases we take into consideration the changes induced by stellar evolution on the number of massive stars, the number of ionizing photons, and the integrated mechanical luminosity of the star-forming regions. The latter is at all times compared with the critical luminosity that defines, for a given size, the lower mechanical luminosity limit above which the matter reinserted via strong winds and supernova explosions suffers frequent and recurrent thermal instabilities that reduce its temperature and pressure and inhibit its exit as part of a global wind. Instead, the unstable reinserted matter is compressed by the pervasive hot gas, and photoionization maintains its temperature at T {\textasciitilde} 104 K. As the evolution proceeds, more unstable matter accumulates and the unstable clumps grow in size. Here we evaluate the possible self-shielding of thermally unstable clumps against the UV radiation field. Self-shielding allows for a further compression of the reinserted matter, which rapidly develops a high-density neutral core able to absorb in its outer skin the incoming UV radiation. Under such conditions the cold (T {\textasciitilde} 10 K) neutral cores soon surpass the Jeans limit and become gravitationally unstable, creating a new stellar generation with the matter reinserted by former massive stars. We present the results of several calculations of this positive star formation feedback scenario promoted by strong radiative cooling and mass loading.},

abstract = {Aims: The CEMP-no stars are "carbon-enhanced-metal-poor" stars that in principle show no evidence of s- and r-elements from neutron captures. We try to understand the origin and nucleosynthetic site of their peculiar CNO, Ne-Na, and Mg-Al abundances. Methods: We compare the observed abundances to the nucleosynthetic predictions of AGB models and of models of rotating massive stars with internal mixing and mass loss. We also analyze the different behaviors of $\alpha$- and CNO-elements, as well the abundances of elements involved in the Ne-Na and Mg-Al cycles. Results: We show that CEMP-no stars exhibit products of He-burning that have gone through partial mixing and processing by the CNO cycle, producing low 12C/13C and a broad variety of [C/N] and [O/N] ratios. From a 12C/13C vs. [C/N] diagram, we conclude that neither the yields of AGB stars (in binaries or not) nor the yields of classic supernovae can fully account for the observed CNO abundances in CEMP-no stars. Better agreement is obtained once the chemical contribution by stellar winds of fast-rotating massive stars is taken into account, where partial mixing takes place, leading to various amounts of CNO being ejected. The [(C+N+O)/H] ratios of CEMP-no stars vary linearly with [Fe/H] above [Fe/H] = -4.0 indicating primary behavior by (C+N+O). Below [Fe/H] = -4.0, [(C+N+O)/H] is almost constant as a function of [Fe/H], implying very high [(C+N+O)/Fe] ratios up to 4 dex. In view of the timescales, such abundance ratios reflect more individual nucleosynthetic properties, rather than an average chemical evolution. The high [(C+N+O)/Fe] ratios (as well as the high [(C+N+O)/$\alpha$-elements]) imply that stellar winds from partially mixed stars were the main source of these excesses of heavy elements now observed in CEMP-no stars. The ranges covered by the variations of [Na/Fe], [Mg/Fe], and [Al/Fe] are much broader than for the $\alpha$-elements (with an atomic mass number above 24) and are comparable to the wide ranges covered by the CNO elements. Nevertheless, the ratios [Na/N] and [Mg/Al] are about constant for CEMP-no stars of different [Fe/H]. This is consistent with the view that the Ne-Na and Mg-Al cycles were significantly operating in the source stars. The very different properties of CNO, Ne-Na, and Mg-Al elements from those of $\alpha$-elements further support the idea that these elements (which all give to CEMP-no stars their peculiarities) originate in slow stellar winds of massive stars experiencing partial mixing. Conclusions: CEMP-no stars present a wide variety in the [C/Fe], [N/Fe], [O/Fe], [Na/Fe], [Mg/Fe], [Al/Fe], and [Sr/Fe] ratios. We show that back-and-forth, partial mixing between the He- and H-regions may account for this variety. Some s-elements, mainly of the first peak, may even be produced by these processes in a small fraction of the CEMP-no stars. We propose a classification scheme for the CEMP-no and low-s stars, based on the changes in composition produced by these successive back-and-forth mixing motions.},

abstract = {We present a catalog of 422 galaxies with published measurements of their globular cluster (GC) populations. Of these, 248 are E galaxies, 93 are S0 galaxies, and 81 are spirals or irregulars. Among various correlations of the total number of GCs with other global galaxy properties, we find that N GC correlates well though nonlinearly with the dynamical mass of the galaxy bulge M_{dyn} = 4 \sigma _e^2 R_e /G, where $\sigma$ e is the central velocity dispersion and Re the effective radius of the galaxy light profile. We also present updated versions of the GC specific frequency SN and specific mass SM versus host galaxy luminosity and baryonic mass. These graphs exhibit the previously known U-shape: highest SN or SM values occur for either dwarfs or supergiants, but in the midrange of galaxy size (109-1010 L ⊙) the GC numbers fall along a well-defined baseline value of SN {\textasciitilde}= 1 or SM = 0.1, similar among all galaxy types. Along with other recent discussions, we suggest that this trend may represent the effects of feedback, which systematically inhibited early star formation at either very low or very high galaxy mass, but which had its minimum effect for intermediate masses. Our results strongly reinforce recent proposals that GC formation efficiency appears to be most nearly proportional to the galaxy halo mass M halo. The mean "absolute" efficiency ratio for GC formation that we derive from the catalog data is M GCS/M halo = 6 {\texttimes} 10-5. We suggest that the galaxy-to-galaxy scatter around this mean value may arise in part because of differences in the relative timing of GC formation versus field-star formation. Finally, we find that an excellent empirical predictor of total GC population for galaxies of all luminosities is N GC {\textasciitilde} (Re $\sigma$ e )1.3, a result consistent with fundamental plane scaling relations.},

abstract = {We present an abundance analysis of 96 horizontal branch (HB) stars in NGC 2808, a globular cluster exhibiting a complex multiple stellar population pattern. These stars are distributed in different portions of the HB and cover a wide range of temperature. By studying the chemical abundances of this sample, we explore the connection between HB morphology and the chemical enrichment history of multiple stellar populations. For stars lying on the red HB, we use GIRAFFE and UVES spectra to determine Na, Mg, Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Zn, Y, Ba and Nd abundances. For colder, blue HB stars, we derive abundances for Na, primarily from GIRAFFE spectra. We were also able to measure direct non-local thermodynamic equilibrium He abundances for a subset of these blue HB stars with temperature higher than {\~{ }}9000 K. Our results show that: (i) HB stars in NGC 2808 show different content in Na depending on their position in the colour-magnitude diagram, with blue HB stars having higher Na than red HB stars; (ii) the red HB is not consistent with a uniform chemical abundance, with slightly warmer stars exhibiting a statistically significant higher Na content; and (iii) our subsample of blue HB stars with He abundances shows evidence of enhancement with respect to the predicted primordial He content by $\Delta$Y = +0.09 {\textpm} 0.01 {\textpm} 0.05 (internal plus systematic uncertainty). Our results strongly support theoretical models that predict He enhancement among second-generation(s) stars in globular clusters and provide observational constraints on the second-parameter governing HB morphology.},

abstract = {In this paper, we discuss the origin of the observed correlation between the cluster concentration c and present-day mass function slope $\alpha$ reported by De Marchi, Paresce {\&} Pulone. This relation can either be reproduced from universal initial conditions combined with some dynamical mechanism(s) that alter(s) the cluster structure and mass function over time, or it must arise early on in the cluster lifetime, such as during the gas-embedded phase of cluster formation. Using a combination of Monte Carlo and N-body models for globular cluster evolution performed with the MOCCA and NBODY6 codes, respectively, we explore a number of dynamical mechanisms that could affect the observed relation. For the range of initial conditions considered here, our results are consistent with a universal initial binary fraction $\approx$10 per cent (which does not, however, preclude 100 per cent) and a universal initial stellar mass function resembling the standard Kroupa distribution. Most of the dispersion observed in the c-$\alpha$ relation can be attributed to two-body relaxation and Galactic tides. However, dynamical processes alone could not have reproduced the dispersion in concentration, and we require at least some correlation between the initial concentration and the total cluster mass. We argue that the origin of this trend could be connected to the gas-embedded phase of cluster evolution.},

abstract = {We demonstrate that among the potential sources of the primordial abundance variations of the proton-capture elements in globular-cluster stars proposed so far, such as the hot-bottom burning in massive asymptotic giant branch stars and H burning in the convective cores of supermassive and fast-rotating massive main-sequence (MS) stars, only the supermassive MS stars with M > 104 M⊙ can explain all the observed abundance correlations without any fine-tuning of model parameters. We use our assumed chemical composition for the pristine gas in M13 (NGC 6205) and its mixtures with 50 and 90 per cent of the material partially processed in H burning in the 6 {\texttimes} 104 M⊙ MS model star as the initial compositions for the normal, intermediate, and extreme populations of low-mass stars in this globular cluster, as suggested by its O-Na anticorrelation. We evolve these stars from the zero-age MS to the red giant branch (RGB) tip with the thermohaline and parametric prescriptions for the RGB extra mixing. We find that the 3He-driven thermohaline convection cannot explain the evolutionary decline of [C/Fe] in M13 RGB stars, which, on the other hand, is well reproduced with the universal values for the mixing depth and rate calibrated using the observed decrease of [C/Fe] with MV in the globular cluster NGC5466 that does not have the primordial abundance variations.},

abstract = {Abundances of some 20 elements have been determined for a (biased) sample of 40 red giants having Mv < -1.5 in the chemically inhomogeneous globular cluster $\omega$ Centauri. The results are based on high-resolution, high signal-to-noise echelle spectra and permit one to examine the roles of primordial enrichment and stellar evolutionary mixing effects in the cluster. Our basic conclusions are as follows (1) There is an abundance range -1.8 < [Fe/H] < -0.8, and even more metal rich stars may exist in the cluster. (2) For the $\alpha$ (Mg, Si, Ca, Ti) and iron peak (Cr, Ni) elements and Sc and V, [metal/Fe] is flat as a function of [Fe/H] and is consistent with primordial enrichment from stars having mass greater than 10 Msun, as has been found for field halo stars. (3) There is a large scatter in the abundances of C, N, and 0. The bulk of the stars have -0.9 < [C/Fe] < -0.3 and [O/Fe] {\~{ }} 0.3, as is found at the red giant branch tip in other "normal" (showing no spread in [Fe/H]) clusters of similar abundance, while there also exists a group of CN-strong stars having [C/Fe] {\~{ }} -0.7 and [O/Fe] {\~{ }} -0.5. Nitrogen appears to be enhanced in all of these carbon-depleted stars. These results are most readily explained in terms of evolutionary mixing effects not predicted by standard stellar evolution calculations and are consistent with the earlier suggestions of Cohen {\&} Bell (1986) and Paltoglou {\&} Norris (1989) concerning processing in both the CN and ON cycles in the stars being observed. In contrast, the group of CO-strong stars first identified by Persson et al. (1980) has [C/Fe] {\~{ }} 0.0, [O/Fe] {\~{ }} 0.4, and [N/Fe] {\~{ }} 0.4 (or 0.9 if the nitrogen scale of Brown and Wallerstein is correct) and is suggestive of primordial enrichment of carbon and/or nitrogen from intermediate- and possibly low-mass stars, tempered by later stellar evolutionary effects. (4) [Na/Fe] and [Al/Fe] are anticorrelated with [O/Fe], and there is a positive correlation between [Na/Fe] and [Al/Fe], all of which are most readily explained in terms of evolutionary mixing effects as first suggested by Denisenkov {\&} Denisenkova (1990). Such an explanation is supported by the similar ([Na/Fe], [O/Fe]) anticorrelation reported by Kraft et al. (1993) in the "normal" globular clusters. (5) For the heavy neutron-addition elements (in particular Y, Ba, La, and Nd) [heavy metal/Fe] rises as [Fe/H] increases, in sharp contrast with what is found in the "normal" clusters, while the relative abundances as a function of atomic number are suggestive of s-processing. The increase in [heavy metal/Fe] with [Fe/H] appears independent of the abundance of C, N, O, Na and Al and is most naturally explained as a primordial effect. Guided by the predictions of existing (somewhat uncertain) stellar evolution calculations, we suggest that this results from primordial enrichment from stars having mass as low as 1-3 Msun. (6) If the preceding suggestion is correct, chemical enrichment in $\omega$ Cen occurred over an extended period, perhaps $\ge$1 Gyr.},

abstract = {An updated grid of stellar yields for low- to intermediate-mass thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars is presented. The models cover a range in metallicity Z = 0.02, 0.008, 0.004 and 0.0001, and masses between 1 and 6Msolar. New intermediate-mass (M >= 3Msolar) Z = 0.0001 AGB models are also presented, along with a finer mass grid than used in previous studies. The yields are computed using an updated reaction rate network that includes the latest NeNa and MgAl proton capture rates, with the main result that between {\textasciitilde}6 and 30 times less Na is produced by intermediate-mass models with hot bottom burning. In low-mass AGB models, we investigate the effect, on the production of light elements, of including some partial mixing of protons into the intershell region during the deepest extent of each third dredge-up episode. The protons are captured by the abundant 12C to form a 13C pocket. The 13C pocket increases the yields of 19F, 23Na, the neutron-rich Mg and Si isotopes, 60Fe and 31P. The increase in 31P is by factors of {\textasciitilde}4 to 20, depending on the metallicity. Any structural changes caused by the addition of the 13C pocket into the He intershell are ignored. However, the models considered are of low mass and any such feedback is likely to be small. Further study is required to test the accuracy of the yields from the partial-mixing models. For each mass and metallicity, the yields are presented in a tabular form suitable for use in galactic chemical evolution studies or for comparison to the composition of planetary nebulae.},

abstract = {We propose a new chemical evolution model aimed at explaining the chemical properties of globular clusters (GCs) stars. Our model depends upon the existence of (i) a peculiar pre-enrichment phase in the GC's parent galaxy associated with very low-metallicity Type II supernovae (SNe II) and (ii) localized inhomogeneous enrichment from a single Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) and intermediate-mass (4-7Msolar) asymptotic giant branch field stars. GC formation is then assumed to take place within this chemically peculiar region. Thus, in our model the first low-mass GC stars to form are those with peculiar abundances (i.e. O-depleted and Na-enhanced), while `normal' stars (i.e. O-rich and Na-depleted) are formed in a second stage when self-pollution from SNe II occurs and the peculiar pollution from the previous phase is dispersed. In this study, we focus on three different GCs: NGC 6752, 6205 (M 13) and 2808. We demonstrate that, within this framework, a model can be constructed which is consistent with (i) the elemental abundance anticorrelations, (ii) isotopic abundance patterns and (iii) the extreme [O/Fe] values observed in NGC 2808 and M 13, without violating the global constraints of approximately unimodal [Fe/H] and C+N+O.},

abstract = {CEMP-s stars are very metal-poor stars with enhanced abundances of carbon and s-process elements. They form a significant proportion of the very metal-poor stars in the Galactic halo and are mostly observed in binary systems. This suggests that the observed chemical anomalies are due to mass accretion in the past from an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star. Because CEMP-s stars have hardly evolved since their formation, the study of their observed abundances provides a way to probe our models of AGB nucleosynthesis at low metallicity. To this end we included in our binary evolution model the results of the latest models of AGB nucleosynthesis and we simulated a grid of 100 000 binary stars at metallicity Z = 0.0001 in a wide range of initial masses and separations. We compared our modelled stars with a sample of 60 CEMP-s stars from the SAGA database of metal-poor stars. For each observed CEMP-s star of the sample we found the modelled star that reproduces best the observed abundances. The result of this comparison is that we are able to reproduce simultaneously the observed abundance of the elements affected by AGB nucleosynthesis (e.g. C, Mg, s-elements) for about 60% of the stars in the sample.},

abstract = {This paper provides a detailed analysis of the main component of the slow neutron capture process (the s-process), which accounts for the solar abundances of half of the nuclei with 90 ≲ A ≲ 208. We examine the impact of the uncertainties of the two neutron sources operating in low-mass asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars: the 13C($\alpha$, n)16O reaction, which releases neutrons radiatively during interpulse periods (kT {\~{ }} 8 keV), and the 22Ne($\alpha$, n)25Mg reaction, partially activated during the convective thermal pulses (TPs). We focus our attention on the branching points that mainly influence the abundance of s-only isotopes. In our AGB models, the 13C is fully consumed radiatively during interpulse. In this case, we find that the present uncertainty associated with the 13C($\alpha$, n)16O reaction has marginal effects on s-only nuclei. On the other hand, a reduction of this rate may increase the amount of residual (or unburned) 13C at the end of the interpulse: in this condition, the residual 13C is burned at higher temperature in the convective zone powered by the following TP. The neutron burst produced by the 22Ne($\alpha$, n)25Mg reaction has major effects on the branches along the s-path. The contributions of s-only isotopes with 90 ≲ A $\le$ 204 are reproduced within solar and nuclear uncertainties, even if the 22Ne($\alpha$, n)25Mg rate is varied by a factor of 2. Improved $\beta$-decay and neutron capture rates of a few key radioactive nuclides would help to attain a comprehensive understanding of the solar main component.},

abstract = {A detailed review of progress in understanding the last stages of evolution of low and intermediate mass stars is presented. The thermal pulse phase of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) evolution is addressed first, and estimates and implications of noncatastrophic mass loss and ejection from AGB stars are reviewed. The concept of synthetic AGB evolution is presented and the algorithms that follow from this concept are used to review estimates of the ages of stellar aggregates that contain AGB stars. Evolution to the white dwarf state as well as the nature of type I 1/2 supernovae are discussed. Theoretical predictions are compared with observations, emphasizing predictions about the surface abundances given by 'canonical' stellar evolution versus abundances estimated from spectroscopic observations.},

abstract = {Realistic ab-initio 3D, radiative-hydrodynamical convection simulations of the solar granulation have been applied to Fe i and Fe ii line formation. In contrast to classical analyses based on hydrostatic 1D model atmospheres the procedure contains no adjustable free parameters but the treatment of the numerical viscosity in the construction of the 3D, time-dependent, inhomogeneous model atmosphere and the elemental abundance in the 3D spectral synthesis. However, the numerical viscosity is introduced purely for numerical stability purposes and is determined from standard hydrodynamical test cases with no adjustments allowed to improve the agreement with the observational constraints from the solar granulation. The non-thermal line broadening is mainly provided by the Doppler shifts arising from the convective flows in the solar photosphere and the solar oscillations. The almost perfect agreement between the predicted temporally and spatially averaged line profiles for weak Fe lines with the observed profiles and the absence of trends in derived abundances with line strengths, seem to imply that the micro- and macroturbulence concepts are obsolete in these 3D analyses. Furthermore, the theoretical line asymmetries and shifts show a very satisfactory agreement with observations with an accuracy of typically 50-100 m s-1 on an absolute velocity scale. The remaining minor discrepancies point to how the convection simulations can be refined further.},

abstract = {Like all true stars, massive stars are gravitationally confined thermonuclear reactors whose composition evolves as energy is lost to radiation and neutrinos. Unlike lower-mass stars (M<{\textasciitilde}8Msolar), however, no point is ever reached at which a massive star can be fully supported by electron degeneracy. Instead, the center evolves to ever higher temperatures, fusing ever heavier elements until a core of iron is produced. The collapse of this iron core to a neutron star releases an enormous amount of energy, a tiny fraction of which is sufficient to explode the star as a supernova. The authors examine our current understanding of the lives and deaths of massive stars, with special attention to the relevant nuclear and stellar physics. Emphasis is placed upon their post-helium-burning evolution. Current views regarding the supernova explosion mechanism are reviewed, and the hydrodynamics of supernova shock propagation and ``fallback'' is discussed. The calculated neutron star masses, supernova light curves, and spectra from these model stars are shown to be consistent with observations. During all phases, particular attention is paid to the nucleosynthesis of heavy elements. Such stars are capable of producing, with few exceptions, the isotopes between mass 16 and 88 as well as a large fraction of still heavier elements made by the r and p processes.},

We have run two simulations: a low-resolution one of around 300,000 zones and a high-resolution one consisting of 2,000,000 zones. Both simulations have been evolved for about 4 hr of stellar time. We observe the existence of fast, downward flowing plumes that are able to transport hydrogen into close proximity to the helium-burning shell before burning takes place. The intershell in the 3D model is richer in protons than the 1D model by several orders of magnitude and so we obtain substantially higher hydrogen-burning luminosities{\textemdash}over 108 L {\&}sun; in the high-resolution simulation{\textemdash}than are found in the 1D model. Convective velocities in these simulations are over ten times greater than the predictions of mixing length theory, though the 3D simulations have greater energy generation due to the enhanced hydrogen burning. We find no evidence of the convective zone splitting into two, though this could be as a result of insufficient spatial resolution or because the models have not been evolved for long enough. We suggest that the 1D mixing length theory and particularly the use of a diffusion algorithm for mixing do not give an accurate picture of these events. An advective mixing scheme may give a better representation of the transport processes seen in the 3D models.},

abstract = {One possible scenario for the formation of carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars is the accretion of carbon-rich material from a binary companion which may no longer visible. It is generally assumed that the accreted material remains on the surface of the star and does not mix with the interior until first dredge-up. However, thermohaline mixing should mix the accreted material with the original stellar material as it has a higher mean molecular weight. We investigate the effect that this has on the surface abundances by modelling a binary system of metallicity Z=10-4 with a 2 M_⊙ primary star and a 0.74 M_⊙ secondary star in an initial orbit of 4000 days. The accretion of material from the wind of the primary leads to the formation of a carbon-rich secondary. We find that the accreted material mixes fairly rapidly throughout 90% of the star, with important consequences for the surface composition. Models with thermohaline mixing predict very different surface abundances after first dredge-up compared to canonical models of stellar evolution.},

abstract = {Observations of heavy elements in red giant stars clearly show that low-mass AGB stars can provide a nucleosynthesis site of the s-process. Stellar evolution models produced over the last years indicate that radiative burning of 13C between succeeding thermal pulses in low-mass AGB star models may indeed provide the neutrons for the s-process. However, although it seems clear that some mixing between the proton-rich envelope and the carbon-rich core may lead to the production of 13C, the physical mechanism responsible for such mixing is not yet unambiguously identified. We present stellar model calculations which include mixing due to overshoot and rotation. Overshoot, with a time-dependent and exponentially decaying efficiency, leads to a partial mixture of protons and 12C during the third dredge-up (TDU), when the envelope convection zone reaches deep into the core. According to the depth-dependent ratio of protons and 12C, a small 13C pocket forms underneath a 14N-rich layer. Overshoot does not allow for any mixing after the envelope convection zone retreats at the end of the TDU after each pulse. Rotation introduces mixing driven by large angular velocity gradients which form at the envelope-core interface in AGB stars, in particular after a thermal pulse. This leads to partial mixing after a pulse, as in the case of overshoot. However, both mechanisms differ during the interpulse phase. Rotation continues to mix the region of the 13C-pocket. This does not only spread the 13C-pocket, but also the more massive 14N-rich layer, and finally leads to mixture of both layers. By the time when the temperature there has risen to about 9{\texttimes}107K and neutron production sets in, the 14N abundance exceeds the 13C abundance by a factor of 5...10. We analyze the role of 14N as a neutron poison by considering the recycling of neutron via 14N(n,p)14C and 12C(p,$\gamma$)13N($\beta$+)13C qualitatively. We find that as long as X(14N) << X(12C), the s-process will still be possible to occur under radiative conditions.},

abstract = {Context: We present the physical and chemical properties of intermediate-mass star models of low metallicity, as they evolve along the thermal pulse phase. Aims: We extend to low metallicities, of Z =1, 2 and 6{\texttimes}10-4, models previously computed for chemical compositions typical of globular clusters of an intermediate metallicity (Z = 0.001), and for the most metal-rich clusters found in our Galaxy (Z = 0.004). We aim to test in particular the self-enrichment scenario for metal-poor globular clusters. Methods: We calculated three grids of intermediate-mass models with metallicities Z = 10-4, 2{\texttimes}10-4, and 6{\texttimes}10-4, following their evolutionary sequences from the pre-main-sequence to the asymptotic giant branch phase, almost until the ejection of the entire envelope. We discuss the chemistry of the ejecta, and, in particular, the mass fractions of elements that have been studied in the numerous, deep, spectroscopic surveys of globular clusters. Results: Although oxygen and sodium data are scarce for low-metallicity globular clusters, the small amonut of data avalilable for the unevolved stars in NGC 6397 are compatible with the models. Furthermore, we find good agreement with the C-N anticorrelation of unevolved stars in the cluster M 15. In this cluster, however, no stars of low oxygen ([O/Fe] {\textasciitilde} -1) abundance have been detected. The most massive, very metal-poor clusters, should contain such stars, according to the present models. At the lowest metallicity Z=10-4, the ejecta of the most massive AGBs have C/O > 1, due to the dramatic decrease in the oxygen abundance. We discuss the possible implications of this prediction.},

abstract = {Aims.Galactic globular cluster (GC) stars exhibit abundance patterns that are not shared by their field counterparts, e.g. the well-documented O-Na and Mg-Al anticorrelations. Recent spectroscopic observations of GC turnoff stars have provided compelling evidence that these abundance anomalies were already present in the gas from which the observed stars formed. A widely held hypothesis is that the gas was {\textquotedblleft}polluted{\textquotedblright} by stars that were more massive (and evolving faster) than the presently observed low-mass stars. In the framework of this {\textquotedblleft}self-enrichment{\textquotedblright} scenario for GCs, we present a new method of deriving the initial mass function (IMF) of the polluters, by using the O/Na abundance distribution. Methods: We focus on NGC 2808, a GC for which the largest sample of O and Na abundance determinations is presently available. We use the abundance distribution of [O/Na] to derive the amount of polluted material with respect to the original composition. We explore two scenarios in detail for the self-enrichment of the cluster, which differ by the assumptions made on the composition of the polluter ejecta. In each case we consider two classes of possible {\textquotedblleft}culprits{\textquotedblright}: massive asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars (4-9 M⊙) and winds of massive stars (WMS) in the mass range 10-100 M⊙. Results: We obtain upper limits for the slope of the IMF (assumed to be given by a power-law) of the stars initially more massive than the present turnoff mass. We also derive lower limits for the amount of stellar residues in NGC 2808. Conclusions: We find that the polluter IMF had to be much flatter than the presently observed IMFs in stellar clusters, which agrees with the results of two other GC IMF determination methods, which we also discuss. Likewise, we find that the present mass of the GC should be totally dominated by stellar remnants if the polluters were AGB stars, which is not the case if the culprits are WMS. We critically analyse the advantages and shortcomings of each potential polluter class and find the WMS scenario more attractive.},

The calculations include the most recent interior physics and the latest generation of non-grey atmosphere models. We provide mass-age-color-magnitude relationships for both metallicities. The mass-M_V and mass-M_K relations are in excellent agreement with the empirical relations derived observationally. The theoretical color-magnitude diagrams are compared with the sequences of globular clusters (47 Tucanae) and open clusters (NGC2420 and NGC2477) observed with the Hubble Space Telescope. Comparison is also made with field star sequences in M_V-(V-I), M_K-(I-K) and M_K-(J-K) diagrams. These comparisons show that the most recent improvements performed in low-mass star atmosphere models yield now reliable stellar models in the near-infrared. These models can be used for metallicity, mass, temperature and luminosity calibrations. Uncertainties still remain, however, in the optical spectral region below T_eff {\textasciitilde} 3700K, where predicted (V-I) colors are too blue by 0.5 mag for a given magnitude. The possible origins for such a discrepancy, most likely a missing source of opacity in the optical and the onset of grain formation are examined in detail.

abstract = {Despite their astrophysical significance-as a major contributor to cosmic nucleosynthesis and as distance indicators in observational cosmology-Type Ia supernovae lack theoretical explanation. Not only is the explosion mechanism complex due to the interaction of (potentially turbulent) hydrodynamics and nuclear reactions, but even the initial conditions for the explosion are unknown. Various progenitor scenarios have been proposed. After summarizing some general aspects of Type Ia supernova modeling, recent simulations of our group are discussed. With a sequence of modeling starting (in some cases) from the progenitor evolution and following the explosion hydrodynamics and nucleosynthesis we connect to the formation of the observables through radiation transport in the ejecta cloud. This allows us to analyze several models and to compare their outcomes with observations. While pure deflagrations of Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarfs and violent mergers of two white dwarfs lead to peculiar events (that may, however, find their correspondence in the observed sample of SNe Ia), only delayed detonations in Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarfs or sub-Chandrasekhar-mass explosions remain promising candidates for explaining normal Type Ia supernovae.},

Having a cadence of a few days and sufficient non-detections prior to explosion, we constrain rise-times, i.e. the durations from estimated first to maximum light, as a function of effective wavelength. At restframe g-band (4722A), we find a distribution of fast rise-times with median of (7.5+/-0.3) days. Comparing these durations with analytical shock models of Rabinak and Waxman (2013); Nakar and Sari (2010) and hydrodynamical models of Tominaga et al. (2009), which are mostly sensitive to progenitor radius at these epochs, we find a median characteristic radius of less than 400 solar radii. The inferred radii are on average much smaller than the radii obtained for observed red supergiants (RSG). Investigating the post-maximum slopes as a function of effective wavelength in the light of theoretical models, we find that massive hydrogen envelopes are still needed to explain the plateaus of SNe II. We therefore argue that the SN II rise-times we observe are either a) the shock cooling resulting from the core collapse of RSG with small and dense envelopes, or b) the delayed and prolonged shock breakout of the collapse of a RSG with an extended atmosphere or embedded within pre-SN circumstellar material.},

Thus, the photospheric elemental abundances of these stars allow us to draw conclusions about details of nuclear burning and mixing processes in the precursor AGB stars. We summarize the state of the art of stellar evolution models that simulate AGB evolution and the occurrence of a late He-shell flash. We compare predicted elemental abundances to those determined by quantitative spectral analyses performed with advanced non-LTE model atmospheres. Good qualitative and quantitative agreement is found. Future work can contribute to an even more complete picture of the nuclear processes in AGB stars.},

The basic features of the abundance distribution are as follows: (1) few, if any, stars exist on the giant branch of $\omega$ Cen with [Ca/H] less than {\~{ }}-1.6; (2) there is a well-defined peak in the distribution at [Ca/H] = -1.4, with a long tail stretching up to [Ca/H] {\~{ }}-0.3; and (3) the distribution is bimodal with a second smaller peak in the distribution at [Ca/H] = -0.9. The distribution may be well fitted by two components each having a simple closed box abundance distribution and for which the ratio of more metal rich to more metal poor is {\~{ }}0.2. We argue that the present data, taken together with the abundance patterns of the s-process elements in this cluster reported by in 1994 by Vanture, Wallerstein, {\&} Brown and in 1995 by Norris {\&} Da Costa, are most convincingly described in terms of the two components representing successive epochs of star formation in the cluster, rather than of their being two independent merging fragments. Examination of the radial distribution of [Ca/H] suggests that there is an abundance gradient in the cluster, consistent with its having been formed in a dissipative manner. The picture emerges of $\omega$ Cen having evolved within the Searle-Zinn paradigm of Galactic globular cluster formation, from a gaseous protocloud of mass perhaps as large as {\~{ }}108 Msun and initial abundance [Ca/H] {\~{ }} -1.5 on a timescale 1 Gyr, well away from the central region of the forming Galaxy and later coming into dynamical equilibrium with it.},

Optical and near-infrared spectroscopy of this H ll region yields He, N, O, Ne, and S abundances for the interstellar matter (ISM) in this galaxy. The spectra were acquired with several different telescope/instrument combinations in order to assess the quality of the derived uncertainties. With oxygen abundance of 3.3 x 10 -5 (12 + log (O/H) = 7.5), this galaxy is similar to GR 8 and among the most metal poor dwarf irregulars known to date. However, the H II region in UGC 4483 has high excitation and higher surface brightness than GR 8, allowing very accurate abundance estimates. The N/O ratio is 3%, in good agreement with other low-metallicity dwarf galaxies. The S/O abundance ratio in UGC 4483 is close to the solar ratio, consistent with results for I Zw 18 and other low-metallicity dwarf irregulars. A He/H abundance of 0.079 +/- 0.002 is derived from observations of the lambda 6678 He ll emission line. A comparison of observations obtained with different telescopes and with the same telescope on different nights supports our relatively small estimated uncertainty in this measurement. We determine that the neutral helium fraction is insignificant through both direct observations of the He(+)/H(+) ratio across the nebula and through photoionization modeling. This results in a helium mass fraction of 0.239 +/- 0.006, consistent with the most recent theoretical and observational determinations of the primordial helium abundance. We also discuss remaining systematic uncertainties in the calculation of the primordial helium abundance},

abstract = {Globular clusters were thought to be simple stellar populations, but recent photometric and spectroscopic evidence suggests that the clusters' early formation history was more complicated. In particular, clusters show star-to-star abundance variations, and multiple sequences in their colour-magnitude diagrams. These effects seem to be restricted to globular clusters, and are not found in open clusters or the field. In this paper, we combine the two competing models for these multiple populations and include a consideration of the effects of stellar collisions. Collisions are one of the few phenomena which occur solely in dense stellar environments like (proto)globular clusters. We find that runaway collisions between massive stars can produce material which has abundances comparable to the observed second generations, but that very little total mass is produced by this channel. We then add the contributions of rapidly rotating massive stars (under the assumption that massive stars are spun up by collisions and interactions), and the contribution of asymptotic giant branch stars. We find that collisions can help produce the extreme abundances which are seen in some clusters. However, the total amount of material produced in these generations is still too small (by at least a factor of 10) to match the observations. We conclude with a discussion of the additional effects which probably need to be considered to solve this particular problem.},

abstract = {We present a comprehensive study of s-process nucleosynthesis in 15, 20, 25, and 30 Msolar stellar models having solar-like initial composition. The stars are evolved up to ignition of central neon with a 659 species network coupled to the stellar models. In this way, the initial composition from one burning phase to another is consistently determined, especially with respect to neutron capture reactions. The aim of our calculations is to gain a full account of the s-process yield from massive stars. In the present work, we describe our code in detail and then focus primarily on results from the s-process during central helium burning. We also illuminate some major uncertainties affecting the calculations. In order to motivate future work on burning in advanced stellar phases, we briefly present some results on the s-process in carbon shell burning; however, we leave a complete analysis of the s-process during the advanced evolutionary phases to a subsequent paper. Our results can help to constrain the yield of the s-process material from massive stars during their presupernova evolution.},

abstract = {A new scenario - early disc accretion - has recently been proposed to explain the discovery of multiple stellar populations in Galactic globular clusters. According to this model, the existence of well defined (anti-)correlations amongst light element abundances (i.e. C, N, O, Na) in the photospheres of stars belonging to the same cluster (and the associated helium enrichment) is caused by accretion of the ejecta of short-lived interacting massive binary systems (and single fast rotating massive stars) on fully convective pre-main sequence low- and very low-mass stars, during the early stages of the cluster evolution. In a previous paper we applied this scenario to the cluster NGC 2808, showing how the knowledge of the He abundance of its triple main sequence can constrain both the He abundance of the accreted matter and the accretion efficiency. Here we have investigated the constraints provided by considering simultaneously the observed spread of lithium and oxygen (and when possible also sodium) abundances for samples of turn-off stars in NGC 6752, NGC 6121 (M4), and NGC 104 (47Tuc), and the helium abundance of their multiple main sequences. These observations provide a very powerful test of the accretion scenario, because the observed O, Li, and He abundance distributions at the turn-off can be used to constrain the composition (and mass) of the accreted matter and the timescales of the polluting stars. In the case of NGC 6752, we could not find a physically consistent solution. If early disc accretion does happen, observations point towards accretion of gas with a non-negligible Li abundance, contrary to the expectations for the ejecta of the "natural" polluters in this scenario. For M4, spectroscopic errors are too large compared to the intrinsic spread, to constrain the properties of the accreted matter. As for 47Tuc, we could find a physically consistent solution for the abundances of He and O (and Na) in the accreted gas and predict the abundances of these elements in the accreted matter - that will have to be reproduced by evolutionary calculations for the polluters and simulations of the global evolution of the intracluster gas - only if pollution happens with timescales of {\textasciitilde}1 Myr, so polluters are objects with masses of several tens of solar masses. Accurate spectroscopic measurements of Li and other light elements in dwarf stars in a larger sample of clusters are needed to test this scenario more comprehensively.},

abstract = {Final evolution of the stars in the mass range of 8-12M has been investigated fully taking account of the effects of electron captures and oxygen deflagration. Only an 0-Ne-Mg core has been treated numerically from the stages well in advance of electron captures and of oxygen burning. It is found that a convective core is formed as a result of entropy production by the electron captures on 24Mg and 20Ne. It delays the onset of the oxygen deflagration to a stage with the central density as high as 2.5 {\texttimes} 1010 g cm-3. Because of such high densities beta processes overcome the oxygen deflagration and the core continues to contract quasi-dynamically. Behind the deflagration front the core material is processed into nuclear statistical equilibrium, from which energy is being lost by the processes of the electron captures, the photodissociations of nuclei, and the neutron drips. The total, i.e., the gravitational plus thermal energy of the core is decreasing at an appreciable rate. Though the numerical computation was stopped at the central density of 1 {\texttimes} 1011 g cm-3, it is likely that the contraction continues to form a neutron star.},

abstract = {We report the detection of deuterium absorption at redshift 2.525659 toward Q1243+3047. We describe improved methods to estimate the deuterium to hydrogen abundance ratio (D/H) in absorption systems, including improved modeling of the continuum level, the Ly$\alpha$ forest, and the velocity structure of the absorption. Together with improved relative flux calibration, these methods give D/H=2.42+0.35-0.25{\texttimes}10-5 from our Keck I HIRES spectra of Q1243+3047, where the error is from the uncertainty in the shape of the continuum level and the amount of D absorption in a minor second component. The measured D/H is likely the primordial value because [O/H]=-2.79+/-0.05. This absorption system has a neutral hydrogen column density logNHI=19.73+/-0.04 cm-2, shows five D lines, and is mostly ionized. The best estimate of the primordial D/H is 2.78+0.44-0.38{\texttimes}10-5, from the logD/H-values toward five QSOs. The dispersion in the five values is larger than we expect from their individual measurement errors, and we suspect this is because some of these errors were underestimated. We observe a trend in D/H with logNHI that we also suspect is spurious. The best value for D/H is 0.6 $\sigma$ smaller than we quoted in O'Meara et al. from three QSOs, and although we have more values, the error is similar because the dispersion is larger. In standard big bang nucleosynthesis (SBBN), the best D/H corresponds to a baryon-to-photon ratio $\eta$=5.9+/-0.5{\texttimes}10-10 and gives precise predictions for the primordial abundances of the other light nuclei. We predict more 4He than is reported in most measurements, although not more than allowed by some estimates of the systematic errors. We predict a 3He abundance very similar to that reported by Bania et al., and we predict 3-4 times more 7Li than is seen in halo stars. It is unclear if those stars could have destroyed this much of their 7Li. The $\eta$-value from D/H corresponds to a cosmological baryon density $\Omega$bh2=0.0214+/-0.0020 (+/-9.3%), which agrees with the WMAP value of $\Omega$bh2=0.0224+/-0.001.},

abstract = {Context: More and more evidence leads to considering classical Be stars as rotating close to the critical velocity. If so, then the question that arises is the origin of this high surface velocity. Aims: We determine which mechanisms accelerate the surface of single stars during the main sequence evolution. We study their dependence on the metallicity and derive the frequency of stars with different surface velocities in clusters of various ages and metallicities. Methods: We have computed 112 stellar models of four different initial masses between 3 and 60 M⊙, at four different metallicities between 0 and 0.020, and with seven different values of the ratio $\Omega$/$\Omega$_crit between 0.1 and 0.99. For all the models, computations were performed until either the end of the main sequence evolution or until the critical limit was reached. Results: The evolution of surface velocities during the main sequence lifetime results from an interplay between meridional circulation (bringing angular momentum to the surface) and mass loss by stellar winds (removing it). The dependence on metallicity of these two mechanisms plays a key role in determining, for each metallicity, a limiting range of initial masses (spectral types) for stars able to reach or at least approach the critical limit. Present models predict a higher frequency of fast rotating stars in clusters with ages between 10 and 25 Myr. This is the range of ages where most of Be stars are observed. To reproduce the observed frequencies of Be stars, it is necessary to first assume that the Be star phenomenon already occurs for stars with $\upsilon$/$\upsilon$_crit$\ge$ 0.7 and, second, that the fraction of fast rotators on the zero-age main sequence is higher at lower metallicities. Depending on the stage at which the star becomes a Be star, it may present either larger or less enrichments in nitrogen at the surface.},

As recognized long ago, the R parameter, i.e., the number ratio of stars in horizontal over red giant branch of old stellar clusters, would be reduced by the axion production from photon conversions occurring in stellar cores. In this regard, we have compared the measured R with state-of-the-art stellar models obtained under different assumptions for ga $\gamma$ . We show that the estimated value of ga $\gamma$ substantially depends on the adopted He mass fraction Y , an effect often neglected in previous investigations. Taking as a benchmark for our study the most recent determinations of the He abundance in H ii regions with O /H in the same range of the Galactic Globular Clusters, we obtain an upper bound ga $\gamma$<0.66 {\texttimes}10-10 GeV-1 at 95% confidence level. This result significantly improves the constraints from previous analyses and is currently the strongest limit on the axion-photon coupling in a wide mass range.},

Our main findings are the following. (1) We confirm that M54 shows intrinsic metallicity dispersion, {\textasciitilde}0.19 dex rms. (2) When the stars of the Sgr nucleus are included, the metallicity distribution strongly resembles that in $\omega$ Cen; the relative contribution of the most metal-rich stars is, however, different in these two objects. (3) In both globular clusters (GCs) there is a very extended Na-O anticorrelation, which is a signature of different stellar generations born within the cluster. (4) The metal-poor and metal-rich components in M54 (and $\omega$ Cen) show clearly distinct extension of the Na-O anticorrelation, the most heavily polluted stars being those of the metal-rich component. We propose a tentative scenario for cluster formation that could explain these features.

abstract = {Over the last 40 years, the 12C +12C fusion reaction has been the subject of considerable experimental efforts to constrain uncertainties at temperatures relevant for stellar nucleosynthesis. Recent studies have indicated that the reaction rate may be higher than that currently used in stellar models. In order to investigate the effect of an enhanced carbon-burning rate on massive star structure and nucleosynthesis, new stellar evolution models and their yields are presented exploring the impact of three different 12C +12C reaction rates. Non-rotating stellar models considering five different initial masses, 15, 20, 25, 32 and 60 M{\&}sun;, at solar metallicity, were generated using the Geneva Stellar Evolution Code (GENEC) and were later post-processed with the NuGrid Multi-zone Post-Processing Network tool (MPPNP). A dynamic nuclear reaction network of {\~{ }}1100 isotopes was used to track the s-process nucleosynthesis. An enhanced 12C +12C reaction rate causes core carbon burning to be ignited more promptly and at lower temperature. This reduces the neutrino losses, which increases the core carbon-burning lifetime. An increased carbon-burning rate also increases the upper initial mass limit for which a star exhibits a convective carbon core (rather than a radiative one). Carbon-shell burning is also affected, with fewer convective-shell episodes and convection zones that tend to be larger in mass. Consequently, the chance of an overlap between the ashes of carbon-core burning and the following carbon shell convection zones is increased, which can cause a portion of the ashes of carbon-core burning to be included in the carbon shell. Therefore, during the supernova explosion, the ejecta will be enriched by s-process nuclides synthesized from the carbon-core s-process. The yields were used to estimate the weak s-process component in order to compare with the Solar system abundance distribution. The enhanced rate models were found to produce a significant proportion of Kr, Sr, Y, Zr, Mo, Ru, Pd and Cd in the weak component, which is primarily the signature of the carbon-core s-process. Consequently, it is shown that the production of isotopes in the Kr-Sr region can be used to constrain the 12C +12C rate using the current branching ratio for $\alpha$- and p-exit channels.},

abstract = {Context. Precise S abundances are important in the study of the early chemical evolution of the Galaxy. In particular the site of the formation remains uncertain because, at low metallicity, the trend of this $\alpha$-element versus [Fe/H] remains unclear. Moreover, although sulfur is not bound significantly in dust grains in the ISM, it seems to behave differently in DLAs and old metal-poor stars. Aims: We attempt a precise measurement of the S abundance in a sample of extremely metal-poor stars observed with the ESO VLT equipped with UVES, taking into account NLTE and 3D effects. Methods: The NLTE profiles of the lines of multiplet 1 of S I were computed with a version of the program MULTI, including opacity sources from ATLAS9 and based on a new model atom for S. These profiles were fitted to the observed spectra. Results: We find that sulfur in EMP stars behaves like the other $\alpha$-elements, with [S/Fe] remaining approximately constant below [Fe/H] = -3. However, [S/Mg] seems to decrease slightly with increasing [Mg/H]. The overall abundance patterns of O, Na, Mg, Al, S, and K are most closely matched by the SN model yields by Heger {\&} Woosley. The [S/Zn] ratio in EMP stars is solar, as also found in DLAs. We derive an upper limit to the sulfur abundance [S/Fe] < +0.5 for the ultra metal-poor star CS 22949-037. This, along with a previously reported measurement of zinc, argues against the conjecture that the light-element abundance pattern of this star (and by analogy, the hyper iron-poor stars HE 0107-5240 and HE 1327-2326) would be due to dust depletion.

abstract = {High-resolution spectroscopic studies of globular clusters (GC) have been a major break-through in our understanding of these ancient stellar systems. The observations carried out in the last dec- ade revealed a very heterogeneous population of objects {\textendash} not only have GCs undergone a complex star formation history resulting in large chemical inhomogeneities common amongst all of them, but there are also non-negligible cluster-to-cluster differences in both chemistry and kinematics that are not yet fully understood. In this thesis, we present the first ever high-resolution studies of two poorly known GCs M 75 and NGC 4372. M 75 is a massive, relatively metal-rich, outer halo GC with extremely broad horizontal branch. We found that, besides the typical light-element variations, it shows a marginal spread in metallicity and likely has a small s-process rich population. Surpris- ingly for its metallicity, the majority of the analysed stars lack s-process enrichment, which hints to a formation in an environment that built metals very quickly. On the other hand, NGC 4372 is one of the most metal-poor GCs in the Galaxy. It is found in the inner halo and has experienced multiple disk crossings. The chemical analysis revealed it as a standard representative of the old, metal-poor halo group. More interesting are its structural and kinematic properties as the cluster has an unusually high intrinsic rotation for its metallicity and appears to be rotationally flattened. Furthermore, since GCs trace the chemical properties of their environment, the thesis also includes the first homogeneous study of the Galactic halo evolution of the poorly studied $\alpha$ element sulphur traced by GC stars covering a large metallicity span.},

Spectra of 64 giants selected from the objective prism survey of Bond (1980) were obtained at a resolution of 8 A in the spectral region 3100-5300 A. C/Fe and N/Fe abundance ratios were estimated from the spectra by the method of spectrum synthesis using metallicities estimated from H and K line strengths. Halo giants with metallicities greater than or equal to -2.0, which are characteristic of giants in the M3 and M13 clusters, are found to have C/Fe and N/Fe abundance distributions similar to those of M3 but not M13, for which a greater carbon depletion and nitrogen enhancement is observed. Halo giants with metallicities less than -2.0 showed less carbon depletion and nitrogen enhancement than the corresponding M29 stars. Globular cluster and field halo stars with the same metallicities thus do not appear to be derived from the same parent population.},

abstract = {Context. Type Iax supernovae (SNe Iax) are proposed as one new sub-class of SNe Ia since they present sufficiently distinct observational properties from the bulk of SNe Ia. Observationally, SNe Iax have been estimated to account for {\textasciitilde}5%-30% of the total SN Ia rate, and most SNe Iax have been discovered in late-type galaxies. In addition, observations constrain the progenitor systems of some SN Iax progenitors that have ages of <80 Myr. Although the identity of the progenitors of SNe Iax is unclear, the weak deflagration explosions of Chandrasekhar-mass (Ch-mass) carbon/oxygen white dwarfs (C/O WDs) seem to provide a viable physical scenario. Aims: Comparing theoretical predictions from binary population synthesis (BPS) calculations with observations of SNe Iax, we put constraints on the single-degenerate (SD) Ch-mass model as a possible SN Iax progenitor. Methods: Based on the SD Ch-mass model, the SN rates and delay times are predicted by combining binary evolution calculations for the progenitor systems into a BPS model. Moreover, with current X-ray observations of SNe Iax, we constrain the pre-explosion mass-loss rates of stellar progenitor systems by using two analytic models. Results: From our calculations, the long delay times of ≳3 Gyr and low SN rates of {\textasciitilde}3 {\texttimes} 10-5 yr-1 are found in the red-gaint donor channel, indicating that this channel is unlikely to produce SNe Iax. With our standard models, we predict that the Galactic SN Iax rate from the main-sequence (helium-star) donor scenario is {\textasciitilde}1.5 {\texttimes} 10-3 yr-1 ({\textasciitilde}3 {\texttimes} 10-4 yr-1). The total rate of these two models is consistent with the observed SN Iax rate. The short delay times in the helium-star donor channel (<100 Myr) support the young host environments of SNe Iax. However, the relatively long delay times in the main-sequence donor channel ({\textasciitilde}250 Myr-1 Gyr) are less favourable for the observational constraints on the ages of SN Iax progenitors. Finally, with current X-ray observations for SNe Iax, we set an upper limit on the pre-SN mass-loss rate at {\.{M}} ≲ a few {\texttimes} 10-4M⊙ yr-1 (for a wind velocity of vw = 100 km s-1). Conclusions: The delay times in the SD Ch-mass model do not account for a significant number of SNe Iax being located in late-type, star-forming galaxies. However, at least one SN Iax event (SN 2008ge) is hosted by an S0 galaxy with no signs of star formation. Current X-ray observations for SNe Iax cannot rule out the SD Ch-mass model. Taking all these into account and considering the uncertainty of the observed rate for SN Iax events, we suggest that some SNe Iax may be produced from weak deflagrations of Ch-mass C/O WDs in SD progenitor systems, especially in the helium-star donor channel. This is consistent with recent analysis of HST observations, which suggests that the SN Iax SN2012Z had a progenitor system which contained a helium-star companion. However, this SD deflagration model is still unlikely to be the most common progenitor scenario for SNe Iax.},

abstract = {In 1964, Refsdal hypothesized that a supernova whose light traversed multiple paths around a strong gravitational lens could be used to measure the rate of cosmic expansion. We report the discovery of such a system. In Hubble Space Telescope imaging, we have found four images of a single supernova forming an Einstein cross configuration around a redshift z = 0.54 elliptical galaxy in the MACS J1149.6+2223 cluster. The cluster{\textquoteright}s gravitational potential also creates multiple images of the z = 1.49 spiral supernova host galaxy, and a future appearance of the supernova elsewhere in the cluster field is expected. The magnifications and staggered arrivals of the supernova images probe the cosmic expansion rate, as well as the distribution of matter in the galaxy and cluster lenses.},

abstract = {We develop a model for stochastic pre-enrichment and self-enrichment in globular clusters (GCs) during their formation process. GCs beginning their formation have an initial metallicity determined by the pre-enrichment of their surrounding protocloud, but can also undergo internal self-enrichment during formation. Stochastic variations in metallicity arise because of the finite numbers of supernova. We construct an analytic formulation of the combined effects of pre-enrichment and self-enrichment and use Monte Carlo models to verify that the model accurately encapsulates the mean metallicity and metallicity spread among real GCs. The predicted metallicity spread due to self-enrichment alone, a robust prediction of the model, is much smaller than the observed spread among real GCs. This result rules out self-enrichment as a significant contributor to the metal content in most GCs, leaving pre-enrichment as the viable alternative. Self-enrichment can, however, be important for clusters with masses well above 106 M sun, which are massive enough to hold in a significant fraction of their SN ejecta even without any external pressure confinement. This transition point corresponds well to the mass at which a mass-metallicity relationship (MMR, "blue tilt") appears in the metal-poor cluster sequence in many large galaxies. We therefore, suggest that self-enrichment is the primary driver for the MMR. Other predictions from our model are that the cluster-to-cluster metallicity spread decreases amongst the highest mass clusters; and that the red GC sequence should also display a more modest mass-metallicity trend if it can be traced to similarly high mass.},

abstract = {We have compiled a catalog of absolute proper motions of globular clusters from various sources. The sample consists of 38 clusters, from which most of the southern ones (15 clusters) were measured in our previous papers in this series. We have integrated orbits assuming two different Galactic potential models adopted from the literature and have calculated orbital parameters. The uncertainties associated with the orbital parameters were derived in a Monte Carlo approach, and we conclude that, overall, at the present level of measurement errors, orbital differences due to Galactic potential models are not significant. Three metal-poor clusters are found to have orbits similar to prototypical metal-rich disk clusters. These clusters are NGC 6254 (M10), NGC 6626 (M28), and NGC 6752. We interpret this as a potentially significant constraint on the formation of the disk. It is thus possible that part of the inner metal-poor halo is the low-metallicity tail of the thick disk. In this case, the ages of these clusters indicate that the formation of the disk partially overlapped with that of the halo. The clusters classified as ``young halo'' or ``red horizontal-branch'' by Zinn show a radially anisotropic velocity distribution, their orbits are of high total energy, with apocentric radii larger than 10 kpc and highly eccentric. In this sense they may represent an accreted component of our Galaxy. We also discuss omega Cen's orbit characteristics in the view of an accreted origin. We investigate the effect of the orbital motion on the internal dynamics of clusters. Adopting the formalism from Gnedin {\&} Ostriker and their destruction rates due to two-body relaxation, we find that, in most cases, this internal process is more important than the destruction processes due to disk and bulge shocking. Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations argue that NGC 6397's luminosity function is depleted at the faint end, and this is blamed on its high total destruction rate. We propose a list of clusters with similar destruction rates that may also have depleted luminosity functions. We also note the bias toward deriving higher destruction rates in studies that statistically assign tangential velocities based on a kinematic model of the globular cluster system, in contrast to the rates derived from the measured tangential velocities. Clusters prone to such biases are those that have circular orbits (kinematically thick-disk clusters) and some of those with orbits of high total energy.},

abstract = {Context. Both recent observations and stellar evolution models suggest that pair-instability supernovae (PISNe) could occur in the local Universe, at metallicities below ≲Z⊙/3. Previous PISN models were mostly produced at very low metallicities in the context of the early Universe. Aims: We present new PISNe models at a metallicity of Z = 0.001, which are relevant for the local Universe. Methods: We took previously published self-consistent stellar evolutionary models of pair-instability progenitors with initial masses of 150 M⊙ and 250 M⊙ at metallicity of Z = 0.001 and followed the evolution of these models through the supernova explosions, using a hydrodynamics stellar evolution code with an extensive nuclear network including 200 isotopes. Results: In both models the stars explode as PISNe without leaving a compact stellar remnant. Our models produce a nucleosynthetic pattern that is generally similar to that of Population III PISN models, which is mainly characterized by the production of large amounts of $\alpha$-elements and a strong deficiency of the odd-charged elements. However, the odd-even effect in our models is significantly weaker than that found in Population III models. The comparison with the nucleosynthetic yields from core-collapse supernovae at a similar metallicity (Z = 0.002) indicates that PISNe could have strongly influenced the chemical evolution below Z $\approx$ 0.002, assuming a standard initial mass function. The odd-even effect is predicted to be most prominent for the intermediate-mass elements between silicon and calcium. Conclusions: With future observations of chemical abundances in Population II stars, our result can be used to constrain the number of PISNe that occurred during the past evolution of our Galaxy.

abstract = {We present optical observations of the peculiar stripped-envelope supernovae (SNe) LSQ12btw and LSQ13ccw discovered by the La Silla-QUEST survey. LSQ12btw reaches an absolute peak magnitude of Mg = -19.3 {\textpm} 0.2, and shows an asymmetric light curve. Stringent pre-discovery limits constrain its rise time to maximum light to less than 4 d, with a slower post-peak luminosity decline, similar to that experienced by the prototypical SN Ibn 2006jc. LSQ13ccw is somewhat different: while it also exhibits a very fast rise to maximum, it reaches a fainter absolute peak magnitude (Mg = -18.4 {\textpm} 0.2), and experiences an extremely rapid post-peak decline similar to that observed in the peculiar SN Ib 2002bj. A stringent pre-discovery limit and an early marginal detection of LSQ13ccw allow us to determine the explosion time with an uncertainty of {\textpm}1 d. The spectra of LSQ12btw show the typical narrow He I emission lines characterizing Type Ibn SNe, suggesting that the SN ejecta are interacting with He-rich circumstellar material. The He I lines in the spectra of LSQ13ccw exhibit weak narrow emissions superposed on broad components. An unresolved H$\alpha$ line is also detected, suggesting a tentative Type Ibn/IIn classification. As for other SNe Ibn, we argue that LSQ12btw and LSQ13ccw likely result from the explosions of Wolf-Rayet stars that experienced instability phases prior to core collapse. We inspect the host galaxies of SNe Ibn, and we show that all of them but one are hosted in spiral galaxies, likely in environments spanning a wide metallicity range.},

abstract = {The goal of this Letter is to analyze the impact of a primary neutron source on the s-process nucleosynthesis in massive stars at halo metallicity. Recent stellar models including rotation at very low metallicity predict a strong production of primary 14N. Part of the nitrogen produced in the H-burning shell diffuses by rotational mixing into the He core where it is converted to 22Ne providing additional neutrons for the s-process. We present nucleosynthesis calculations for a 25 Msolar star at [Fe/H] = -3, -4, where about 0.8% in mass is made of primary 22Ne in the convective He-burning core. The usual weak s-process shape is changed by the additional neutron source with a peak between Sr and Ba, where the s-process yields increase by orders of magnitude with respect to the yields obtained without rotation. Iron seeds are fully consumed and the maximum production of Sr, Y, and Zr is reached. On the other hand, the s-process efficiency beyond Sr and the ratio Sr/Ba are strongly affected by the amount of 22Ne and by nuclear uncertainties, first of all by the 22Ne($\alpha$, n)25Mg reaction. Finally, assuming that 22Ne is primary in the considered metallicity range, the s-process efficiency decreases with metallicity due to the effect of the major neutron poisons 25Mg and 22Ne. This work represents a first step toward the study of primary neutron source effect in fast rotating massive stars, and its implications are discussed in the light of spectroscopic observations of heavy elements at halo metallicity.},

abstract = {We examine the hypothesis that magnetic fields are inflating the radii of fully convective main-sequence stars in detached eclipsing binaries (DEBs). The magnetic Dartmouth stellar evolution code is used to analyze two systems in particular: Kepler-16 and CM Draconis. Magneto-convection is treated assuming stabilization of convection and also by assuming reductions in convective efficiency due to a turbulent dynamo. We find that magnetic stellar models are unable to reproduce the properties of inflated fully convective main-sequence stars, unless strong interior magnetic fields in excess of 10 MG are present. Validation of the magnetic field hypothesis given the current generation of magnetic stellar evolution models therefore depends critically on whether the generation and maintenance of strong interior magnetic fields is physically possible. An examination of this requirement is provided. Additionally, an analysis of previous studies invoking the influence of star spots is presented to assess the suggestion that star spots are inflating stars and biasing light curve analyses toward larger radii. From our analysis, we find that there is not yet sufficient evidence to definitively support the hypothesis that magnetic fields are responsible for the observed inflation among fully convective main-sequence stars in DEBs.},

abstract = {Based on the width of its main sequence, and an actual observed split when viewed through particular filters, it is widely accepted that 47 Tucanae contains multiple stellar populations. In this contribution, we divide the main sequence of 47 Tuc into four color groups, which presumably represent stars of various chemical compositions. The kinematic properties of each of these groups are explored via proper motions, and a strong signal emerges of differing proper-motion anisotropies with differing main-sequence color; the bluest main-sequence stars exhibit the largest proper-motion anisotropy which becomes undetectable for the reddest stars. In addition, the bluest stars are also the most centrally concentrated. A similar analysis for Small Magellanic Cloud stars, which are located in the background of 47 Tuc on our frames, yields none of the anisotropy exhibited by the 47 Tuc stars. We discuss implications of these results for possible formation scenarios of the various populations.},

abstract = {High resolution spectra with high signal-to-noise ratios (typically 100) have been obtained for a few halo dwarfs with the 3m.6 CFH telescope. These solar type stars are very old and extremely metal poor. The Li resonance line ($\lambda$6707) is observed, and is essentially produced by the 7Li isotope. Although the mean metal abundance M/H varies from a factor t2 to 250 relative to the Sun, the abundance of lithium is very constant in all these stars, but the coolest ones where the convection zone is deep enough to induce 7Li destruction by proton fusion. The non-destruction of 7Li in very old halo stars (of about the solar type) is to be attributed to the reduction of the size of the convective zone, reduction caused by the very small abundance of the heavy elements. If the problem seems clear for the halo stars it is on the contrary very confusing in Population I stars. It seems however that in the old disk stars the destruction of lithium is also inhibited, probably also by a reduction of the depth of the convective zone due to the slight metal deficiency. It is pointed out, on the other hand, that among G type stars of Population I more than a half have a lithium abundance similar to that of the Hyades, although probably not half of them are as young as the Hyades. It is suggested that the destruction of lithium in solar type stars is sometimes accelerated by the action of another process such as overshooting or turbulent diffusion, which is not always present. We admit that the shape of the distribution of Li abundance in the Pleiades after Duncan (t98 t) rules out a significant destruction of lithium in the protostellar phase for solar type stars. Depletion of Lithium in halo stars by other processes is discussed and found unlikely. After discussion it is suggested that the abundance of lithium in halo dwarfs is therefore representative of the abundance of the interstellar matter which formed the stars and also that this matter itself retains the lithium abundances of the Big Bang, hardly altered. We deduce a primordial value of the lithium abundance 11.2 10-11 NH (or, by mass XLi = 5.96 10-10). The baryonic density of the Universe deduced from this value is compared to the densities deduced from the primordial abundance of deuterium and helium. All these densities are small, and this show that the Universe cannot be closed by nucleons.},

abstract = {Recent pieces of evidence have revealed that most, and possibly all, globular star clusters are composed of groups of stars that formed in multiple episodes with different chemical compositions. In this sense, it has also been argued that variations in the initial helium abundance (Y) from one population to the next are also the rule, rather than the exception. In the case of the metal-intermediate globular cluster M4 (NGC 6121), recent high-resolution spectroscopic observations of blue horizontal branch (HB) stars (i.e., HB stars hotter than the RR Lyrae instability strip) suggest that a large fraction of blue HB stars are second-generation stars formed with high helium abundances. In this paper, we test this scenario by using recent photometric and spectroscopic data together with theoretical evolutionary computations for different Y values. Comparing the photometric data with the theoretically derived color-magnitude diagrams, we find that the bulk of the blue HB stars in M4 have $\Delta$Y <{\textasciitilde} 0.01 with respect to the cluster's red HB stars (i.e., HB stars cooler than the RR Lyrae strip){\textemdash}a result which is corroborated by comparison with spectroscopically derived gravities and temperatures, which also favor little He enhancement. However, the possible existence of a minority population on the blue HB of the cluster with a significant He enhancement level is also discussed.},

Most of the baryons today are still in the form of ionized gas, which contributes a mean density uncertain by a factor of about 4. Stars and their remnants are a relatively minor component, comprising for our best-guess plasma density only about 17% of the baryons, while populations contributing most of the blue starlight comprise less than 5%. The formation of galaxies and of stars within them appears to be a globally inefficient process. The sum over our budget, expressed as a fraction of the critical Einstein-de Sitter density, is in the range 0.007 <{\textasciitilde} $\Omega$B <{\textasciitilde} 0.041, with a best guess of $\Omega$B {\textasciitilde} 0.021 (at Hubble constant 70 km s-1 Mpc-1). The central value agrees with the prediction from the theory of light element production and with measures of the density of intergalactic plasma at redshift z {\textasciitilde} 3. This apparent concordance suggests that we may be close to a complete survey of the major states of the baryons.},

They bear witness to the formation and early evolution of galaxies. They represent unique laboratories for dynamical processes that occur on timescales shorter than the Hubble time. Last but not least, they are invaluable laboratories to test the stellar evolution theory. However, and despite their broad astrophysical importance, their origin and formation processes still remain uncertain. Clues on the early stages of globular cluster evolution may however be found in the peculiar abundance patterns of their long-lived low-mass stars. Recent spectroscopic observations of these objects provided evidence that their abundance anomalies in light elements from carbon to aluminium result from early pollution of the intracluster gas by more massive and faster evolving stars. Here we discuss the possibility that the Wind of Fast Rotating Massive Stars could be at the origin of these abundance anomalies.},

abstract = {Context. Models of primordial and hyper-metal-poor stars that have masses similar to the Sun are known to experience an ingestion of protons into the hot core during the core helium flash phase at the end of their red giant branch evolution. This produces a concurrent secondary flash powered by hydrogen burning that gives rise to further nucleosynthesis in the core. Aims: We aim to model the nucleosynthesis occurring during the proton ingestion event to ascertain if any significant neutron-capture nucleosynthesis occurs. Methods: We perform post-process nucleosynthesis calculations on a one-dimensional stellar evolution calculation of a star with mass 1 M_⊙ and a metallicity of [Fe/H] = -6.5 that suffers a proton ingestion episode. Our network includes 320 nuclear species and 2366 reactions and treats mixing and burning simultaneously. Results: We find that the mixing and burning of protons into the hot convective core leads to the production of 13C, which then burns via the 13C($\alpha$, n)16O reaction, releasing a large number of free neutrons. During the first two years of neutron production the neutron poison 14N abundance is low, allowing the prodigious production of heavy elements such as strontium, barium, and lead via slow neutron captures (the s process). These nucleosynthetic products are later carried to the stellar surface and ejected via stellar winds. We compare our results with observations of the hyper-metal-poor halo star HE 1327-2326, which shows a strong Sr overabundance. Conclusions: Our model provides the possibility of self-consistently explaining the Sr overabundance in HE 1327-2326 together with its C, N, and O overabundances (all within a factor of {\~{ }} {\textasciitilde}4) if the material were heavily diluted, for example, via mass transfer in a wide binary system. The model produces at least 18 times too much Ba than observed, but this may be within the large modelling uncertainties. In this scenario, binary systems of low mass must have formed in the early Universe. If this is true, it puts constraints on the primordial initial mass function.},

It is shown that the characteristic diffusion time scale associated with collisions between grains and gas atoms is considerably longer than that on which star formation is expected to occur. Collisions between large grains and gas atoms lead to mass segregation and metallicity gradients on a time scale comparable to the crossing time of the clusters in the Galaxy. One possible mechanism for inducing and maintaining chemical homogeneity is turbulent diffusion in the clouds. The mixing time scale required in this case is comparable to several internal dynamical time scales, longer than the evolutionary time scale of the most massive stars, and shorter than the Galactic orbital time scale of the clouds. Thus, metals in presently observed stars probably did not originate from upper main-sequence stars of a coeval generation.},

abstract = {Context: Winds of asymptotic giant branch stars are assumed to be driven by radiation pressure on dust. Previously, this process has been modeled with detailed time-dependent simulations of atmospheres and winds assuming spherically symmetric flows. In such models kinetic energy is injected by a variable inner boundary ({\textquotedblleft}piston{\textquotedblright}) simulating the effects of stellar pulsation. However, the dynamical processes in these atmospheres - convection and pulsations - are actually three-dimensional. Aims: We present and analyze first 3D radiation hydrodynamics simulations of the convective interior and the atmosphere of a typical AGB star. In particular, we check whether the piston description in the 1D wind models is compatible with the 3D results. Methods: We used two different RHD codes, one (CO5BOLD) to produce 3D models of the outer convective envelope and the inner atmosphere of an AGB star, the other to describe the atmosphere and the wind acceleration region, including dust formation and non-grey radiative transfer, but assuming spherically symmetric flows. From the movements of stellar surface layers in the 3D models, we derived a description for the variable inner boundary in the 1D models. Results: The 3D models show large convection cells and pulsations that give rise to roughly spherically expanding shock waves in the atmosphere, levitating material into regions which are cool enough to allow for dust formation. The atmospheric velocity fields have amplitudes and time scales close to the values that are necessary to start dust formation in the 1D wind models. Conclusions: The convection cells in the 3D simulations are so large that the associated shock fronts appear almost spherical, justifying the assumption of spherical symmetry and the use of a piston boundary condition in the context of wind models. Nevertheless, certain non-radial structures exist in the dust shell developing in the 3D simulations which should be detectable with current interferometric techniques.},

abstract = {The surface magnetic field strength of white dwarfs is observed to vary from very little to around 109G. Here, we examine the proposal that the strongest fields are generated by dynamo action during the common envelope phase of strongly interacting stars that leads to binary systems containing at least one white dwarf. The resulting magnetic field depends strongly on the electrical conductivity of the white dwarf, the lifetime of the convective envelope and the variability of the magnetic dynamo. We assess the various energy sources available and estimate necessary lifetimes of the common envelope. In the case of a dynamo that leads a randomly oriented magnetic field, we find that the induced field is confined to a thin boundary layer at the surface of the white dwarf. This then decays away rapidly upon dispersal of the common envelope. The residual field is typically less than 10-8 times the strength of the external field. Only in the case where there is some preferential direction to the dynamo-generated field can an induced field, which avoids rapid decay, be produced. We show that a surface field of a magnitude a fewper cent of the external field may be produced after a few Myr. In this case, the residual field strength is roughly proportional to the lifetime of the dynamo activity.},

The simplest explanation, a small vacuum energy (cosmological constant), raises three difficult issues: why the vacuum energy is so small, why it is not quite zero, and why it is comparable to the matter density today. I discuss these mysteries, some of their possible resolutions, and some issues confronting future observations.

Sulfur abundances have been computed using the near-IR lines of [S III] $\lambda$$\lambda$9069, 9532 along with [S III] temperatures. We find average values, expressed logarithmically with a standard deviation, of log(S/O)=-1.91+/-0.24, log(Cl/O)=-3.52+/-0.16, and log(Ar/O)=-2.29+/-0.18, numbers consistent with previous studies of both planetary nebulae and H II regions. We also find a strong correlation between [O III] and [S III] temperatures among planetary nebulae. In analyzing abundances of Ne, S, Cl, and Ar with respect to O, we find a tight correlation for Ne-O, and loose correlations for Cl-O and Ar-O. All three trends appear to be colinear with observed correlations for H II regions. S and O also show a correlation, but there is a definite offset from the behavior exhibited by H II regions and stars. We suggest that this S anomaly is most easily explained by the existence of S+3, whose abundance must be inferred indirectly when only optical spectra are available, in amounts in excess of what is predicted by model-derived ionization correction factors in PNe. Finally for the disk PNe, abundances of O, Ne, S, Cl, and Ar all show gradients when plotted against Galactocentric distance. The slopes are statistically indistinguishable from one another, a result which is consistent with the notion that the cosmic abundances of these elements evolve in lockstep.},

abstract = {Aims: We investigate the Ba and Eu abundances for a sample of 63 giant stars in the globular cluster M 15. This is the largest sample of M 15 giant stars for which Ba abundances have been determined and, due to the target selection of the original research programme, the Ba abundances are complete along the red giant branch. Methods: Stellar parameters were taken from the previous key study and a microturbulence-surface gravity relation was determined for precise measurement of the Ba line at 6496.898 {\AA}, which has a high sensitivity to microturbulence. Element abundances for Ba, La, Eu, Ca, Ni and Fe were calculated using spectrum synthesis and equivalent widths techniques. Results: A bimodal distribution in Ba, Eu and La abundances was found within the sample. The low Ba, Eu, La mode had mean abundances of {\textlangle}[Ba/H]{\textrangle} = - 2.41 {\textpm} 0.16, {\textlangle}[Eu/H]{\textrangle} = - 1.80 {\textpm} 0.08 and {\textlangle}[La/H]{\textrangle} = - 2.19 {\textpm} 0.13 while the high Ba, Eu, La mode had mean abundances of {\textlangle}[Ba/H]{\textrangle} = - 2.00 {\textpm} 0.16, {\textlangle}[Eu/H]{\textrangle} = - 1.65 {\textpm} 0.13 and {\textlangle}[La/H]{\textrangle} = - 1.95 {\textpm} 0.11. Conclusions: Both modes are indicative of a pollution scenario dominated by the r-process, hence contributions from explosive nucleosynthesis of massive stars. There may be evidence of further enhancement by another heavy element process and of potential anticorrelations in Na-O for both modes indicating a complex formation and evolution history for M 15.

We assume that a previous generation of massive low-metallicity Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars has polluted the cluster gas via a slow stellar wind. We use two independent sets of AGB yields computed from detailed models to follow the evolution of helium, carbon, nitrogen and oxygen in the cluster gas using a Salpeter initial mass function (IMF) and a number of top-heavy IMFs. In no case were we able to fit the observational constraints, Y > 0.30 and C+N+O $\approx$ constant. Depending on the shape of the IMF and the yields, we either obtained Y gtrsim 0.30 and large increases in C+N+O or Y < 0.30 and C+N+O $\approx$ constant. These results suggest that either AGB stars alone are not responsible for the large helium enrichment or that any dredge-up from this generation of stars was less than predicted by standard models.},

abstract = {In this article we first review the main physical effects to be considered in the building of evolutionary models of rotating stars on the Upper Main-Sequence (MS). The internal rotation law evolves as a result of contraction and expansion, meridional circulation, diffusion processes, and mass loss. In turn, differential rotation and mixing exert a feedback on circulation and diffusion, so that a consistent treatment is necessary. We review recent results on the evolution of internal rotation and the surface rotational velocities for stars on the Upper MS, for red giants, supergiants, and W-R stars. A fast rotation enhances the mass loss by stellar winds and, conversely, high mass loss removes a lot of angular momentum. The problem of the breakup or $\Omega$-limit is critically examined in connection with the origin of Be and LBV stars. The effects of rotation on the tracks in the HR diagram, the lifetimes, the isochrones, the blue-to-red supergiant ratios, the formation of Wolf-Rayet stars, and the chemical abundances in massive stars as well as in red giants and AGB stars are reviewed in relation to recent observations for stars in the Galaxy and Magellanic Clouds. The effects of rotation on the final stages and on the chemical yields are examined, along with the constraints placed by the periods of pulsars. On the whole, this review points out that stellar evolution is not only a function of mass M and metallicity Z, but of angular velocity $\Omega$ as well.},

abstract = {We put constraints on the properties of the progenitors of peculiar calcium-rich transients using the distribution of locations within their host galaxies. We confirm that this class of transients do not follow the galaxy stellar mass profile and are more likely to be found in remote locations of their apparent hosts. We test the hypothesis that these transients are from low-metallicity progenitors by comparing their spatial distributions with the predictions of self-consistent cosmological simulations that include star formation and chemical enrichment. We find that while metal-poor stars and our transient sample show a consistent preference for large offsets, metallicity alone cannot explain the extreme cases. Invoking a lower age limit on the progenitor helps to improve the match, indicating these events may result from a very old metal-poor population. We also investigate the radial distribution of globular cluster systems, and show that they too are consistent with the class of calcium-rich transients. Because photometric upper limits exist for globular clusters for some members of the class, a production mechanism related to the dense environment of globular clusters is not favoured for the calcium-rich events. However, the methods developed in this paper may be used in the future to constrain the effects of low metallicity on radially distant core-collapse events or help establish a correlation with globular clusters for other classes of peculiar explosions.},

abstract = {The discovery of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy, which is being tidally disrupted by and merging with the Milky Way, supports the view that the halo of the Galaxy has been built up at least partially by the accretion of similar dwarf systems. The Sagittarius dwarf contains several distinct populations of stars, and includes M54 as its nucleus, which is the second most massive globular cluster associated with the Milky Way. The most massive globular cluster is $\omega$ Centauri, and here we report that $\omega$ Centauri also has several distinct stellar populations, as traced by red-giant-branch stars. The most metal-rich red-giant-branch stars are about 2Gyr younger than the dominant metal-poor component, indicating that $\omega$ Centauri was enriched over this timescale. The presence of more than one epoch of star formation in a globular cluster is quite surprising, and suggests that $\omega$ Centauri was once part of a more massive system that merged with the Milky Way, as the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy is in the process of doing now. Mergers probably were much more frequent in the early history of the Galaxy and $\omega$ Centauri appears to be a relict of this era.},

We derive radial velocities of 1951 stars in 12 GCs from single order spectra taken with Hectochelle on the MMT telescope. To this sample we add an analysis of available archival data of individual stars. For the full set of data we fit King models to derive consistent dynamical parameters for the clusters. We find good agreement between single-mass King models and the observed radial dispersion profiles. The large, uniform sample of dynamical masses we derive enables us to examine trends of M/L with cluster mass and metallicity. The overall values of M/L and the trends with mass and metallicity are consistent with existing measurements from a large sample of M31 clusters. This includes a clear trend of increasing M/L with cluster mass and lower than expected M/Ls for the metal-rich clusters. We find no clear trend of increasing rotation with increasing cluster metallicity suggested in previous work.},

Main-sequence masses, in the range of 0.6 to 1.3 M_sun;, were chosen in order to produce turnoff luminosities similar to those observed for the galactic globular and old disk clusters. Color-magnitude diagrams were constructed and compared with the observations of all globular clusters for which main-sequence photometry is available. The color-magnitude of the old open cluster NGC 188 has been included in these comparisons. An extensive discussion of the metal content and the helium abundance of globular clusters is given. All of the globular clusters studied are predicted to have ages somewhere in the range of 15-18{\texttimes}109 yr. An excellent fit to the observations of NGC 188 has been achieved which yields an age of $\equiv$10{\texttimes}109 yr for this open cluster if its metallicity is solar. This suggests that an age difference of perhaps as much as 8 billion yr may exist between the halo and the disk clusters. If 18{\texttimes}109 yr is the maximum age of the globulars, this lower limit to the age of the universe requires H0 ⪉ 60 km s-1 Mpc-1 for a Friedmann model with q0 = 0.},

abstract = {We present new grids of colors and bolometric corrections for F-K stars having 4000 K<=Teff<=6500 K, 0.0<=logg<=4.5, and -3.0<=[Fe/H]<=0.0. A companion paper extends these calculations into the M giant regime (3000 K<=Teff<=4000 K). Colors are tabulated for Johnson U-V and B-V, Cousins V-R and V-I, Johnson-Glass V-K, J-K, and H-K, and CIT/CTIO V-K, J-K, H-K, and CO. We have developed these color-temperature relations by convolving synthetic spectra with the best-determined, photometric filter transmission profiles. The synthetic spectra have been computed with the SSG spectral synthesis code using MARCS stellar atmosphere models as input. Both of these codes have been improved substantially, especially at low temperatures, through the incorporation of new opacity data. The resulting synthetic colors have been put onto the observational systems by applying color calibrations derived from models and photometry of field stars that have effective temperatures determined by the infrared flux method. These color calibrations have zero points that change most of the original synthetic colors by less than 0.02 mag, and the corresponding slopes generally alter the colors by less than 5%. The adopted temperature scale, that of Bell {\&} Gustafsson, is confirmed by the extraordinary agreement between the predicted and observed angular diameters of these field stars, indicating that the differences between the synthetic colors and the photometry of the field stars are not due to errors in the effective temperatures adopted for these stars. Thus, we have derived empirical color-temperature relations from the field star photometry, which we use as one test of our calibrated, theoretical, solar-metallicity color-temperature relations. Except for the coolest dwarfs (Teff<5000 K), our calibrated model colors are found to match these relations, as well as the empirical relations of others, quite well, and our calibrated, 4 Gyr, solar-metallicity isochrone also provides a good match to color-magnitude diagrams of M67. We regard this as evidence that our calibrated colors can be applied to many astrophysical problems, including modeling the integrated light of galaxies. Because there are indications that the dwarfs cooler than 5000 K may require different optical color calibrations than the other stars, we present additional colors for our coolest dwarf models that account for this possibility.},

For the brighter stars we find agreement with previous results (four different sequences corresponding to different modes of pulsation in asymptotic giant branch stars). We also discovered two distinct and well-separated sequences below the tip of the red giant branch. They consist of almost 10 000 short-period (15 < P < 50 d), low-amplitude (AI < 0.04) mag red variable stars, for which we propose that a significant fraction is likely to be on the red giant branch, showing radial pulsations in the second and third overtone modes.

abstract = {High-resolution images of the solar surface show a granulation pattern of hot rising and cooler downward-sinking material - the top of the deep-reaching solar convection zone. Convection plays a role for the thermal structure of the solar interior and the dynamo acting there, for the stratification of the photosphere, where most of the visible light is emitted, as well as for the energy budget of the spectacular processes in the chromosphere and corona. Convective stellar atmospheres can be modeled by numerically solving the coupled equations of (magneto)hydrodynamics and non-local radiation transport in the presence of a gravity field. The CO5BOLD code described in this article is designed for so-called "realistic" simulations that take into account the detailed microphysics under the conditions in solar or stellar surface layers (equation-of-state and optical properties of the matter). These simulations indeed deserve the label "realistic" because they reproduce the various observables very well - with only minor differences between different implementations. The agreement with observations has improved over time and the simulations are now well-established and have been performed for a number of stars. Still, severe challenges are encountered when it comes to extending these simulations to include ideally the entire star or substellar object: the strong stratification leads to completely different conditions in the interior, the photosphere, and the corona. Simulations have to cover spatial scales from the sub-granular level to the stellar diameter and time scales from photospheric wave travel times to stellar rotation or dynamo cycle periods. Various non-equilibrium processes have to be taken into account. Last but not least, realistic simulations are based on detailed microphysics and depend on the quality of the input data, which can be the actual accuracy limiter. This article provides an overview of the physical problem and the numerical solution and the capabilities of CO5BOLD, illustrated with a number of applications.},

abstract = {Classical barium stars are binary systems which consist of a late-type giant enriched in carbon and slow neutron capture (s-process) elements and an evolved white dwarf (WD) that is invisible at optical wavelengths. The youngest observed barium stars are surrounded by planetary nebulae (PNe), ejected soon after the wind accretion of polluted material when the WD was in its preceding asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase. Such systems are rare but powerful laboratories for studying AGB nucleosynthesis as we can measure the chemical abundances of both the polluted star and the nebula ejected by the polluter. Here, we present evidence for a barium star in the PN Hen 2-39 (PN G283.8-04.2) as one of only a few known systems. The polluted giant is very similar to that found in WeBo 1 (PN G135.6+01.0). It is a cool (Teff = 4250 {\textpm} 150 K) giant enhanced in carbon ([C/H] = 0.42 {\textpm} 0.02 dex) and barium ([Ba/Fe] = 1.50 {\textpm} 0.25 dex). A spectral type of C-R3 C24 nominally places Hen 2-39 amongst the peculiar early R-type carbon stars; however, the barium enhancement and likely binary status mean that it is more likely to be a barium star with similar properties, rather than a true member of this class. An AGB star model of initial mass 1.8 M⊙ and a relatively large carbon pocket size can reproduce the observed abundances well, provided mass is transferred in a highly conservative way from the AGB star to the polluted star (e.g. wind Roche lobe overflow). It also shows signs of chromospheric activity and photometric variability with a possible rotation period of {\~{ }}5.5 d likely induced by wind accretion. The nebula exhibits an apparent ring morphology in keeping with the other PNe around barium stars (WeBo 1 and A 70) and shows a high degree of ionization implying the presence of an invisible hot pre-WD companion that will require confirmation with UV observations. In contrast to A 70, the nebular chemical abundance pattern is consistent with non-Type I PNe, in keeping with the trend found from nebular s-process studies that non-Type I PNe are more likely to be s-process enhanced.},

abstract = {We present the first hydrodynamic, multidimensional simulations of He shell flash convection. We investigate the properties of shell convection immediately before the He luminosity peak during the 15th thermal pulse of a stellar evolution track with initially 2 solar masses and metallicity Z=0.01. This choice is a representative example of a low-mass asymptotic giant branch thermal pulse. We construct the initial vertical stratification with a set of polytropes to resemble the stellar evolution structure. Convection is driven by a constant volume heating in a thin layer at the bottom of the unstable layer. We calculate a grid of two-dimensional simulations with different resolutions and heating rates, plus one low-resolution three-dimensional run. The flow field is dominated by large convective cells that are centered in the lower half of the convection zone. It generates a rich spectrum of gravity waves in the stable layers both above and beneath the convective shell. The magnitude of the convective velocities from our one-dimensional mixing-length theory model and the rms-averaged vertical velocities from the hydrodynamic model are consistent within a factor of a few. However, the velocity profile in the hydrodynamic simulation is more asymmetric and decays exponentially inside the convection zone. Both g-modes and convective motions cross the formal convective boundaries, which leads to mixing across the boundaries. Our resolution study shows consistent flow structures among the higher resolution runs, and we see indications for convergence of the vertical velocity profile inside the convection zone for the highest resolution simulations. Many of the convective properties, in particular the exponential decay of the velocities, depend only weakly on the heating rate. However, the amplitudes of the gravity waves increase with both the heating rate and the resolution.},

abstract = {When carbon is ignited off-centre in a CO core of a super-asymptotic giant branch star, its burning in a convective shell tends to propagate to the centre. Whether the C flame will actually be able to reach the centre depends on the efficiency of extra mixing beneath the C convective shell. Whereas thermohaline mixing is too inefficient to interfere with the C-flame propagation, convective boundary mixing can prevent the C burning from reaching the centre. As a result, a C-O-Ne white dwarf (WD) is formed, after the star has lost its envelope. Such a `hybrid' WD has a small CO core surrounded by a thick ONe zone. In our 1D stellar evolution computations, the hybrid WD is allowed to accrete C-rich material, as if it were in a close binary system and accreted H-rich material from its companion with a sufficiently high rate at which the accreted H would be processed into He under stationary conditions, assuming that He could then be transformed into C. When the mass of the accreting WD approaches the Chandrasekhar limit, we find a series of convective Urca shell flashes associated with high abundances of 23Na and 25Mg. They are followed by off-centre C ignition leading to convection that occupies almost the entire star. To model the Urca processes, we use the most recent well-resolved data for their reaction and neutrino-energy loss rates. Because of the emphasized uncertainty of the convective Urca process in our hybrid WD models of Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) progenitors, we consider a number of their potentially possible alternative instances for different mixing assumptions, all of which reach a phase of explosive C ignition, either off or in the centre. Our hybrid SN Ia progenitor models have much lower C-to-O abundance ratios at the moment of the explosive C ignition than their pure CO counterparts, which may explain the observed diversity of the SNe Ia.},

abstract = {Rotation has a number of important effects on the evolution of stars. Apart from structural changes because of the centrifugal force, turbulent mixing and meridional circulation caused by rotation can dramatically affect a star{\textquoteright}s chemical evolution. This leads to changes in the surface temperature and luminosity as well as modifying its lifetime. Observationally, rotation decreases the surface gravity, causes enhanced mass loss and leads to surface abundance anomalies of various chemical isotopes. The replication of these physical effects with simple stellar evolution models is very difficult and has resulted in the use of numerous different formulations to describe the physics. Using stellar evolution calculations based on several physical models, we discuss the features of the resulting simulated stellar populations which can help to distinguish between the models.},

abstract = {We have obtained high resolution, high signal-to-noise ratio CCD echelle spectra of 10 bright red giants in 3 globular clusters (47 Tuc, NGC 6752 and NGC 6397) roughly spanning the whole range of metallicities of the galactic globular cluster system. The analysis of this newly acquired material reveals no significant evidence of star-to-star variation of the [Fe/H] ratio in these three clusters. Moreover, a large set of high quality literature data (equivalent widths from high dispersion CCD spectra) was re-analyzed in an homogeneous and self-consistent way to integrate our observations and derive new metal abundances for more than 160 bright red giants in 24 globular clusters (i.e. about 16% of the known population of galactic globulars). This set was then used to define a new metallicity scale for globular clusters which is the result of high quality, direct spectroscopic data, of new and updated model atmospheres from the grid of \cite[Kurucz (1992)]{\ref41}, and of a careful fine abundance analysis; this last, in turn, is based on a common set of both atomic and atmospheric parameters for all the stars examined. Given the very high degree of internal homogeneity, our new scale supersedes the offsets and discrepancies existing in previous attempts to obtain a metallicity scale. The internal uncertainty in [Fe/H] is very small: 0.06 dex (24 clusters) on average, and can be interpreted also as the mean precision of the c luster ranking. Compared to our system, metallicities on the widely used Zinn and West's scale are about 0.10 dex higher for [Fe/H]>-1, 0.23 dex lower for -1<[Fe/H]<-1.9 and 0.11 dex too high for [Fe/H]<-1.9. The non-linearity of the Zinn and West's scale is significant even at 3 sigma level. A quadratic transformation is given to correct older values to the new scale in the range of our calibrating clusters (-2.24 <= [Fe/H]ZW <= -0.51). A minor disagreement is found at low metallicities between the metallicity scale based on field and cluster RR Lyrae variables (via a new calibration of the Delta S index) and our new cluster metallicities. It could be tentatively ascribed to non-linearity in the [Fe/H]-Delta S relationship. The impact of new metallicities on major astrophysical problems is exemplified through a simple exercise on the Oosterhoff effect in the classical pair M 3 and M 15.},

abstract = {Aims:We present new results of our ongoing chemical study of carbon stars in Local Group galaxies to test the critical dependence of s-process nucleosynthesis on the stellar metallicity. Methods: We collected optical spectra with the VLT/UVES instrument of two carbon stars found in the Carina Dwarf Spheroidal (dSph) galaxy, namely ALW-C6 and ALW-C7. We performed a full chemical analysis using the new generation of hydrostatic, spherically symmetric carbon-rich model atmospheres and the spectral synthesis method in LTE. Results: The luminosities, atmosphere parameters and chemical composition of ALW-C6 and ALW-C7 are compatible with these stars being in the TP-AGB phase undergoing third dredge-up episodes, although their extrinsic nature (external pollution in a binary stellar system) cannot be definitively excluded. Our chemical analysis shows that the metallicity of both stars agree with the average metallicity ([Fe/H] -1.8 dex) previously derived for this satellite galaxy from the analysis of both low resolution spectra of RGB stars and the observed colour magnitude diagrams. ALW-C6 and ALW-C7 present strong s-element enhancements, [ s/Fe] = +1.6, +1.5, respectively. These enhancements and the derived s-process indexes [ ls/Fe] , [ hs/Fe] and [ hs/ls] are compatible with theoretical s-process nucleosynthesis predictions in low mass AGB stars ( 1.5 M_⊙) on the basis that the 13C($\alpha$,n)16O is the main source of neutrons. Furthermore, the analysis of C2 and CN bands reveals a large carbon enhancement (C/O 7 and 5, respectively), much larger than the values typically found in galactic AGB carbon stars (C/O 1{-}2). This is also in agreement with the theoretical prediction that AGB carbon stars are formed more easily through third dredge-up episodes as the initial stellar metallicity drops. However, theoretical low-mass AGB models apparently fail to simultaneously fit the observed s-element and carbon enhancements. On the other hand, Zr is found to be less enhanced in ALW-C7 compared to the other elements belonging to the same s-peak. Although the abundance errors are large, the fact that in this star the abundance of Ti (which has a similar condensation temperature to Zr) seems also to be lower than those of others metals, may indicate the existence of some depletion into dust-grains in its photosphere.

Strontium and barium are detected in most cool, metal-poor giants, but are these elements always detectable? To identify stars that could be considered probable candidates for lacking these elements, I examine the stellar abundance data available in the literature for 1148 field stars and 226 stars in dwarf galaxies, 776 of which have metallicities lower than [Fe/H] <-2.0. Strontium or barium have been detected in all field, globular cluster, and dwarf galaxy environments studied. All upper limits are consistent with the lowest detected ratios of [Sr/H] and [Ba/H]. The frequent appearance of these elements raises the intriguing prospect that at least one kind of neutron-capture reaction operates as often as the nucleosynthesis mechanisms that produce lighter elements, such as magnesium, calcium, or iron, although the yields of heavy elements may be more variable.},

abstract = {We have studied how the third dredge-up and the carbon star formation in low-mass asymptotic giant branch stars depend on certain key nuclear reaction rates. From a set of complete stellar evolution calculations of a 2 Msolar model with Z=0.01 including mass loss, we find that varying either the 14N(p, $\gamma$)15O or the triple-$\alpha$ reaction rate within their uncertainties as given in the NACRE compilation results in dredge-up and yields that differ by a factor of 2. Model tracks with a higher rate for the triple-$\alpha$ rate and a lower rate for the 14N(p, $\gamma$)15O reaction both show more efficient third dredge-up. New experimental results for the 14N(p, $\gamma$)15O reaction rates are surveyed, yielding a rate that is about 40% lower than the tabulated NACRE rate and smaller than NACRE's lower limit. We discuss the possible implications of the revised nuclear reaction rate for stellar evolution calculations that aim to reproduce the observed carbon star formation at low mass, which requires efficient third dredge-up.},

abstract = {Context: . Aims: .We examine the role of rotation on the evolution and chemical yields of very metal-poor stars. Methods: .The models include the same physics, which was applied successfully at the solar Z and for the SMC, in particular, shear diffusion, meridional circulation, horizontal turbulence, and rotationally enhanced mass loss. Results: .Models of very low Z experience a much stronger internal mixing in all phases than at solar Z. Also, rotating models at very low Z, contrary to the usual considerations, show a large mass loss, which mainly results from the efficient mixing of the products of the 3$\alpha$ reaction into the H-burning shell. This mixing allows convective dredge-up to enrich the stellar surface in heavy elements during the red supergiant phase, which in turn favours a large loss of mass by stellar winds, especially as rotation also increases the duration of this phase. On the whole, the low Z stars may lose about half of their mass. Massive stars initially rotating at half of their critical velocity are likely to avoid the pair-instability supernova. The chemical composition of the rotationally enhanced winds of very low Z stars show large CNO enhancements by factors of 103 to 10^7, together with large excesses of 13C and 17O and moderate amounts of Na and Al. The excesses of primary N are particularly striking. When these ejecta from the rotationally enhanced winds are diluted with the supernova ejecta from the corresponding CO cores, we find [C/Fe], [N/Fe], [O/Fe] abundance ratios that are very similar to those observed in the C-rich, extremely metal-poor stars (CEMP). We show that rotating AGB stars and rotating massive stars have about the same effects on the CNO enhancements. Abundances of s-process elements and the 12C/13C ratio could help us to distinguish between contributions from AGB and massive stars. Conclusions: .},

abstract = {Context. Our understanding of the s-process nucleosynthesis in asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars is incomplete. AGB models predict, for example, large overabundances of lead (Pb) compared to other s-process elements in metal-poor low-mass AGB stars. This is indeed observed in some extrinsically enhanced metal-poor stars, but not in all. An extensive study of intrinsically s-process enriched objects is essential for improving our knowledge of the AGB third dredge-up and associated s-process nucleosynthesis. Aims: We compare the spectral abundance analysis of the SMC post-AGB star J004441.04-732136.4 with state-of-the-art AGB model predictions with a main focus on Pb. The low signal-to-noise (S/N) in the Pb line region made the result of our previous study inconclusive. We acquired additional data covering the region of the strongest Pb line. Methods: By carefully complementing re-reduced previous data, with newly acquired UVES optical spectra, we improve the S/N of the spectrum around the strongest Pb line. Therefore, an upper limit for the Pb abundance is estimated from a merged weighted mean spectrum using synthetic spectral modeling. We then compare the abundance results from the combined spectra to predictions of tailored AGB evolutionary models from two independent evolution codes. In addition, we determine upper limits for Pb abundances for three previously studied LMC post-AGB objects. Results: Although theoretical predictions for J004441.04-732136.4 match the s-process distribution up to tungsten (W), the predicted very high Pb abundance is clearly not detected. The three additional LMC post-AGB stars show a similar lack of a very high Pb abundance. Conclusions: From our study, we conclude that none of these low-mass, low-metallicity post-AGB stars of the LMC and SMC are strong Pb producers. This conflicts with current theoretical predictions.

abstract = {To better characterize the abundance patterns produced by the r-process, we have derived new abundances or upper limits for the heavy elements zinc (Zn, Z= 30), yttrium (Y, Z= 39), lanthanum (La, Z= 57), europium (Eu, Z= 63), and lead (Pb, Z= 82). Our sample of 161 metal-poor stars includes new measurements from 88 high-resolution and high signal-to-noise spectra obtained with the Tull Spectrograph on the 2.7 m Smith Telescope at the McDonald Observatory, and other abundances are adopted from the literature. We use models of the s-process in asymptotic giant branch stars to characterize the high Pb/Eu ratios produced in the s-process at low metallicity, and our new observations then allow us to identify a sample of stars with no detectable s-process material. In these stars, we find no significant increase in the Pb/Eu ratios with increasing metallicity. This suggests that s-process material was not widely dispersed until the overall Galactic metallicity grew considerably, perhaps even as high as [Fe/H] =-1.4, in contrast with earlier studies that suggested a much lower mean metallicity. We identify a dispersion of at least 0.5 dex in [La/Eu] in metal-poor stars with [Eu/Fe] <+0.6 attributable to the r-process, suggesting that there is no unique "pure" r-process elemental ratio among pairs of rare earth elements. We confirm earlier detections of an anti-correlation between Y/Eu and Eu/Fe bookended by stars strongly enriched in the r-process (e.g., CS 22892-052) and those with deficiencies of the heavy elements (e.g., HD 122563). We can reproduce the range of Y/Eu ratios using simulations of high-entropy neutrino winds of core-collapse supernovae that include charged-particle and neutron-capture components of r-process nucleosynthesis. The heavy element abundance patterns in most metal-poor stars do not resemble that of CS 22892-052, but the presence of heavy elements such as Ba in nearly all metal-poor stars without s-process enrichment suggests that the r-process is a common phenomenon. This paper includes data taken at The McDonald Observatory of The University of Texas at Austin.},

abstract = {Context. Light elements and nitrogen surface abundances together can constrain the mixing efficiencies in massive stars on the main sequence, because moderate mixing in the surface layers leads to depletion of light elements but only later to enrichment in nitrogen. Aims: We want to test the rotational mixing prescriptions included in the Geneva stellar evolution code (GENEC) by following the evolution of surface abundances of light isotopes in massive stars. Methods: The GENEC is a 1D code containing sophisticated prescriptions for rotational mixing. We implemented an extended reaction network into this code including the light elements Li, Be, and B, which allowed us to perform calculations testing the rotation-induced mixing. Results: We followed 9, 12, and 15 M_{\&}sun; models with rotation from the zero age main sequence up to the end of He burning. The calculations show the expected behaviour with faster depletion of light isotopes for faster rotating stars and more massive stars. Conclusions: We find that the mixing prescriptions used in the present rotating models for massive single stars can account for most of the observations; however, the uncertainties are quite large, making it hard to draw a firm conclusion on the mixing scenario.},

We compare predictions produced using the Zr neutron-capture cross sections from Bao et al. and from n_TOF experiments at CERN, and present a new evaluation for the neutron-capture cross section of the unstable isotope 95Zr, the branching point leading to the production of 96Zr. The new cross sections generally present an improved match with the observational data, except for the 92Zr/94Zr ratios, which are on average still substantially higher than predicted. The 96Zr/94Zr ratios can be explained using our range of initial stellar masses, with the most 96Zr-depleted grains originating from AGB stars of masses 1.8-3 M {\&}{\#}9737; and the others from either lower or higher masses. The 90, 91Zr/94Zr variations measured in the grains are well reproduced by the range of stellar metallicities considered here, which is the same needed to cover the Si composition of the grains produced by the chemical evolution of the Galaxy. The 92Zr/94Zr versus 29Si/28Si positive correlation observed in the available data suggests that stellar metallicity rather than rotation plays the major role in covering the 90, 91, 92Zr/94Zr spread.},

abstract = {We present an elemental abundance analysis for four newly discovered ultra metal-poor stars from the Hamburg/ESO survey, with [Fe/H] <= -4. Based on high-resolution, high signal-to-noise spectra, we derive abundances for 17 elements in the range from Li to Ba. Three of the four stars exhibit moderate to large overabundances of carbon, but have no enhancements in their neutron-capture elements. The most metal-poor star in the sample, HE 0233-0343 ([Fe/H] = -4.68), is a subgiant with a carbon enhancement of [C/Fe] = +3.5, slightly above the carbon-enhancement plateau suggested by Spite et al. No carbon is detected in the spectrum of the fourth star, but the quality of its spectrum only allows for the determination of an upper limit on the carbon abundance ratio of [C/Fe] < +1.7. We detect lithium in the spectra of two of the carbon-enhanced stars, including HE 0233-0343. Both stars with Li detections are Li-depleted, with respect to the Li plateau for metal-poor dwarfs found by Spite {\&} Spite. This suggests that whatever site(s) produced C either do not completely destroy lithium, or that Li has been astrated by early-generation stars and mixed with primordial Li in the gas that formed the stars observed at present. The derived abundances for the $\alpha$ elements and iron-peak elements of the four stars are similar to those found in previous large samples of extremely and ultra metal-poor stars. Finally, a large spread is found in the abundances of Sr and Ba for these stars, possibly influenced by enrichment from fast rotating stars in the early universe. Based on observations made with the European Southern Observatory (ESO) Telescopes.},

abstract = {We report the discovery of 59 globular clusters (GCs) and two candidate GCs in a search of the halo of M31, primarily via visual inspection of Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope/MegaCam imagery from the Pan-Andromeda Archaeological Survey (PAndAS). The superior quality of these data also allows us to check the classification of remote objects in the Revised Bologna Catalogue (RBC), plus a subset of GC candidates drawn from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) imaging. We identify three additional new GCs from the RBC, and confirm the GC nature of 11 SDSS objects (8 of which appear independently in our remote halo catalogue); the remaining 188 candidates across both lists are either foreground stars or background galaxies. Our new catalogue represents the first uniform census of GCs across the M31 halo - we find clusters to the limit of the PAndAS survey area at projected radii of up to Rproj {\~{ }} 150 kpc. Tests using artificial clusters reveal that detection incompleteness cuts in at luminosities below MV = -6.0; our 50 per cent completeness limit is MV $\approx$ -4.1. We construct a uniform set of PAndAS photometric measurements for all known GCs outside Rproj = 25 kpc, and any new GCs within this radius. With these data, we update results from Huxor et al., investigating the luminosity function (LF), colours and effective radii of M31 GCs with a particular focus on the remote halo. We find that the GCLF is clearly bimodal in the outer halo (Rproj > 30 kpc), with the secondary peak at MV {\~{ }} -5.5. We argue that the GCs in this peak have most likely been accreted along with their host dwarf galaxies. Notwithstanding, we also find, as in previous surveys, a substantial number of GCs with above-average luminosity in the outer M31 halo - a population with no clear counterpart in the Milky Way.},

abstract = {We report the discovery of a group of apparently young CoRoT red-giant stars exhibiting enhanced [$\alpha$/Fe] abundance ratios (as determined from APOGEE spectra) with respect to solar values. Their existence is not explained bystandard chemical evolution models of the Milky Way, and shows that the chemical-enrichment history of the Galactic disc is more complex. We find similar stars in previously published samples for which isochrone-ages could be reliably obtained, although in smaller relative numbers. This might explain why these stars have not previously received attention. The young [$\alpha$/Fe]-rich stars are much more numerous in the CoRoT-APOGEE (CoRoGEE) inner-field sample than in any other high-resolution sample available at present because only CoRoGEE can explore the inner-disc regions and provide ages for its field stars. The kinematic properties of the young [$\alpha$/Fe]-rich stars are not clearly thick-disc like, despite their rather large distances from the Galactic mid-plane. Our tentative interpretation of these and previous intriguing observations in the Milky Way is that these stars were formed close to the end of the Galactic bar, near corotation - a region where gas can be kept inert for longer times than in other regions that are more frequently shocked by the passage of spiral arms. Moreover, this is where the mass return from older inner-disc stellar generations is expected to be highest (according to an inside-out disc-formation scenario), which additionally dilutes the in-situ gas. Other possibilities to explain these observations (e.g., a recent gas-accretion event) are also discussed. Appendix A is available in electronic form at http://www.aanda.org},

abstract = {The star-to-star differences in the abundance of light elements observed in the globular clusters (GCs) can be explained assuming that a second generation (SG) of stars form in the gas ejected by the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars belonging to a first stellar generation. However, while Na and O appear to be anticorrelated in the cluster stars, from the stellar models they turn out to be correlated in the AGB ejecta. In order to reconcile the stellar theory with the observational findings, all the GC models invoke an early dilution of AGB ejecta with pristine gas occurring during the SG formation. Despite a vast consensus about the occurrence of such a dilution, the physical process behind it is still unknown. In the present paper we set some general constraints on the pristine gas dynamics and on the possible amount of pristine gas involved in the SG formation, making use of a one-zone chemical model. We find that such a dilution is a necessary ingredient in the SG star formation to explain the observed abundance patterns. We confirm the conclusion of our previous works showing that clusters must have been initially much more massive. We also show that models assuming that clusters had an initial mass similar to their current one, and adopting a large fraction of pristine gas to form SG stars, fail to reproduce the observed Na-O anticorrelation and are not viable. We finally show that the dilution event should be restricted in time, rather than extended for the full duration of SG formation.},

Contrary to more metal-rich stars where hot bottom burning is the main driver of the surface composition, in these lower metallicity models the effect of third dredge-up and corrosive second dredge-up also have a strong impact on the yields. These metal-poor and very metal-poor super-AGB stars create large amounts of 4He, 13C, 14N and 27Al as well as the heavy magnesium isotopes 25Mg and 26Mg. There is a transition in yield trends at metallicity Z $\approx$ 0.001, below which we find positive yields of 12C, 16O, 15N and 28Si, which is not the case for higher metallicities. We explore the large uncertainties derived from wind prescriptions in super-AGB stars, finding $\approx$2 orders of magnitude difference in yields of 22Ne, 23Na, 24, 25, 26Mg, 27Al and our s-process proxy isotope g. We find inclusion of variable composition low-temperature molecular opacities is only critical for super-AGB stars of metallicities below Z $\approx$ 0.001. We analyse our results, and those in the literature, to address the question: Are super-AGB stars the polluters responsible for extreme population in the globular cluster NGC 2808? Our results, as well as those from previous studies, seem unable to satisfactorily match the extreme population in this globular cluster.},

abstract = {We use numerical simulations to investigate the orbital characteristics of tidal debris from satellites whose orbits are dragged into the plane of galactic discs by dynamical friction before disruption. We find that these satellites may deposit a significant fraction of their stars into the disc components of a galaxy, and use our results to motivate the search for accretion relics in samples of metal-poor disc stars in the vicinity of the Sun. Satellites disrupted on very eccentric orbits coplanar with the disc are expected to shed stars in `trails' of distinct orbital energy and angular momentum during each pericentric passage. To an observer located between the pericentre and apocentre of such orbits, these trails would show as distinct groupings of stars with low vertical velocity and a broad, symmetric, often double-peaked distribution of Galactocentric radial velocities. One group of stars with these characteristics stands out in available compilations of nearby metal-poor stars. These stars have specific angular momenta similar to that of the globular cluster $\omega$Cen, long hypothesized to be the nucleus of a dwarf galaxy disrupted by the Milky Way tidal field. In addition to their kindred kinematics, stars in the $\omega$Cen group share distinct chemical abundance characteristics, and trace a well-defined track in the [$\alpha$/Fe] versus [Fe/H] plane, consistent with simple closed-box enrichment models and a protracted star formation history. The dynamical and chemical coherence of this group suggests that it consists of stars that once belonged to the dwarf that brought $\omega$Cen into the Galaxy. The presence of this and other `tidal relics' in the solar neighbourhood suggest an extra-Galactic origin for the presence of nearby stars with odd kinematics and chemistry, and implies that accounting for stars contributed by distinct satellite galaxies may be crucial to the success of models of Galactic chemical enrichment.},

abstract = {Context: We study turbulent convection during the core helium flash close to its peak by comparing the results of two and three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations. Aims: In a previous study we found that the temporal evolution and the properties of the convection inferred from two-dimensional hydrodynamic studies are similar to those predicted by quasi-hydrostatic stellar evolutionary calculations. However, as vorticity is conserved in axisymmetric flows, two-dimensional simulations of convection are characterized by incorrect dominant spatial scales and exaggerated velocities. Here, we present three-dimensional simulations that eliminate the restrictions and flaws of two-dimensional models and that provide a geometrically unbiased insight into the hydrodynamics of the core helium flash. In particular, we study whether the assumptions and predictions of stellar evolutionary calculations based on the mixing-length theory can be confirmed by hydrodynamic simulations. Methods: We used a multidimensional Eulerian hydrodynamics code based on state-of-the-art numerical techniques to simulate the evolution of the helium core of a 1.25 M⊙ Pop I star. Results: Our three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of the evolution of a star during the peak of the core helium flash do not show any explosive behavior. The convective flow patterns developing in the three-dimensional models are structurally different from those of the corresponding two-dimensional models, and the typical convective velocities are lower than those found in their two-dimensional counterparts. Three-dimensional models also tend to agree more closely with the predictions of mixing length theory. Our hydrodynamic simulations show the turbulent entrainment that leads to a growth of the convection zone on a dynamic time scale. In contrast to mixing length theory, the outer part of the convection zone is characterized by a subadiabatic temperature gradient.},

abstract = {We present a detailed, three-dimensional hydrodynamic study of the neutrino-driven winds emerging from the remnant of a neutron star merger. Our simulations are performed with the Newtonian, Eulerian code FISH, augmented by a detailed, spectral neutrino leakage scheme that accounts for neutrino absorption. Consistent with earlier two-dimensional studies, a strong baryonic wind is blown out along the original binary rotation axis within $\approx$100 ms. From this model, we compute a lower limit on the expelled mass of 3.5 {\texttimes} 10-3 M⊙, relevant for heavy element nucleosynthesis. Because of stronger neutrino irradiation, the polar regions show substantially larger electron fractions than those at lower latitudes. The polar ejecta produce interesting r-process contributions from A $\approx$ 80 to about 130, while the more neutron-rich, lower latitude parts produce elements up to the third r-process peak near A $\approx$ 195. We calculate the properties of electromagnetic transients powered by the radioactivity in the wind, in addition to the `macronova' transient stemming from the dynamic ejecta. The polar regions produce ultraviolet/optical transients reaching luminosities up to 1041 erg s-1, which peak around 1 d in optical and 0.3 d in bolometric luminosity. The lower latitude regions, due to their contamination with high-opacity heavy elements, produce dimmer and more red signals, peaking after {\~{ }}2 d in optical and infrared.},

The wind contributions in He, C, N, O, Ne, and heavy elements are given. The total stellar yields, including the contributions from the winds, supernovae, and planetary nebulae, are also derived for helium and heavy elements. It is argued that in massive stars, at high Z, large amounts of helium and carbon are ejected into the interstellar medium before being turned into heavier elements. The nucleosynthetic production is found to depend very much on metallicity. Consideration is also given to the consequences on the yields of various values of the lowest initial mass limit MBH for black hole formation, assuming that no or little mass should be lost subsequently to the general relativistic collapse. The yields in heavy elements strongly decrease with the lowering of MBH, since then more heavy elements are swallowed up by black holes.},

We also find that the pre-WR mass loss determines the shape of our maps. We find that different mass-loss rates lead to quite different results.

abstract = {Recently, an increasing number of studies were devoted to measure the abundances of neutron-capture elements heavier than iron in stars belonging to Galactic Open Clusters (OCs). OCs span a sizeable range in metallicity (-0.6 $\le$ [Fe/H] $\le$ +0.4), and they show abundances of light elements similar to disc stars of the same age. A different pattern is observed for heavy elements. A large scatter is observed for Ba, with most OCs showing [Ba/Fe] and [Ba/La] overabundant with respect to the Sun. The origin of this overabundance is not clearly understood. With the goal of providing new observational insights, we determined radial velocities, atmospheric parameters and chemical composition of 27 giant stars members of five OCs: Cr 110, Cr 261, NGC 2477, NGC 2506 and NGC 5822. We used high-resolution spectra obtained with the UVES spectrograph at European Southern Observatory Paranal. We perform a detailed spectroscopic analysis of these stars to measure the abundance of up to 22 elements per star. We study the dependence of element abundance on metallicity and age with unprecedented detail, complementing our analysis with data culled from the literature. We confirm the trend of Ba overabundance in OCs, and show its large dispersion for clusters younger than {\~{ }}4 Gyr. Finally, the implications of our results for stellar nucleosynthesis are discussed. We show in this work that the Ba enrichment compared to other neutron-capture elements in OCs cannot be explained by the contributions from the slow neutron-capture process and the rapid neutron-capture process. Instead, we argue that this anomalous signature can be explained by assuming an additional contribution by the intermediate neutron-capture process.},

abstract = {Star formation from matter including the hot CNO processed ejecta of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) winds is regarded as a plausible scenario to account for the chemical composition of a stellar second generation (SG) in globular clusters. The chemical evolution models, based on this hypothesis, so far included only the yields available for the massive AGB stars, while the possible role of super-AGB ejecta was either extrapolated or not considered. In this work, we explore in detail the role of super-AGB ejecta on the formation of the SG abundance patterns using yields recently calculated by Ventura and D{\textquoteright}Antona. An application of the model to clusters showing extended Na-O anticorrelations, like NGC 2808, indicates that an SG formation history similar to that outlined in our previous work is required: formation of an extreme population with very large helium content from the pure ejecta of super-AGB stars, followed by formation of an intermediate population by dilution of massive AGB ejecta with pristine gas. The present models are able to account for the very O-poor, Na-rich extreme stars once deep-mixing is assumed in SG giants forming in a gas with helium abundance Y > 0.34, which significantly reduces the atmospheric oxygen content, while preserving the sodium abundance. On the other hand, for clusters showing a mild O-Na anticorrelation, like M 4, the use of the new yields broadens the range of SG formation routes leading to abundance patterns consistent with observations. Specifically, our study shows that a model in which SG stars form only from super-AGB ejecta promptly diluted with pristine gas can reproduce the observed patterns. We briefly discuss the variety of (small) helium variations occurring in this model and its relevance for the horizontal branch morphology. In some of these models, the duration of the SG formation episode can be as short as {\~{ }}10 Myr; the formation time of the SG is therefore compatible with the survival of a cooling flow in the cluster core, previous to the explosion of the SG core collapse supernovae. We also explore models characterized by the formation of multiple populations in individual bursts, each lasting no longer than {\~{ }}10 Myr each.},

abstract = {Novae are cataclysmic variables driven by accretion of H-rich material onto a white dwarf (WD) star from its low-mass main-sequence binary companion. New time-domain observational capabilities, such as the Palomar Transient Factory and Pan-STARRS, have revealed a diversity of their behavior that should be theoretically addressed. Nova outbursts depend sensitively on nuclear physics data, and more readily available nova simulations are needed in order to effectively prioritize experimental effort in nuclear astrophysics. In this paper, we use the MESA stellar evolution code to construct multicycle nova evolution sequences with CO WD cores. We explore a range of WD masses and accretion rates as well as the effect of different cooling times before the onset of accretion. In addition, we study the dependence on the elemental abundance distribution of accreted material and convective boundary mixing at the core-envelope interface. Models with such convective boundary mixing display an enrichment of the accreted envelope with C and O from the underlying WD that is commensurate with observations. We compare our results with the previous work and investigate a new scenario for novae with the 3He-triggered convection.},

PNe have also been used to study disk abundance gradients in the Milky Way and other spirals. Here we present an abundance analysis of 37 anticenter PNe observed at APO. We combine these results with our previously obtained data to form a sample of 122 well-observed PNe with galactocentric distances ranging from 3 to 20 kpc, in an effort to examine the oxygen abundance gradient in the Milky Way. In addition to deriving a gradient in a straightforward way from our data, we also undertook a statistical analysis that includes realistic uncertainties in both distances and oxygen abundances. The results indicate that any derived gradient is poorly constrained, consistent with no gradient. Uncertainties in distance and oxygen abundance, coupled with what are likely to be real differences in the PN oxygen abundance at a given Galactocentric radius, lead us to conclude that PNe may simply not be suitable for this type of investigation in the Milky Way.

abstract = {Recently, several studies have shown that young, open clusters are characterized by a considerable overabundance in their barium content. In particular, D'Orazi et al. reported that in some younger clusters [Ba/Fe] can reach values as high as {\~{ }}0.6 dex. The work also identified the presence of an anticorrelation between [Ba/Fe] and cluster age. For clusters in the age range {\~{ }}4.5 Gyr-500 Myr, this is best explained by assuming a higher contribution from low-mass asymptotic giant branch stars to the Galactic chemical enrichment. The purpose of this work is to investigate the ubiquity of the barium overabundance in young stellar clusters. We analysed high-resolution spectroscopic data, focusing on the s-process elemental abundance for three nearby young associations, i.e. AB Doradus, Carina-Near and Ursa Major. The clusters have been chosen such that their age spread would complement the D'Orazi et al. study. We find that while the s-process elements Y, Zr, La and Ce exhibit solar ratios in all three associations, Ba is overabundant by {\~{ }}0.2 dex. Current theoretical models cannot reproduce this abundance pattern; thus, we investigate whether this unusually large Ba content might be related to chromospheric effects. Although no correlation between [Ba/Fe] and several activity indicators seems to be present, we conclude that different effects could be at work which may (directly or indirectly) be related to the presence of hot stellar chromospheres.},

abstract = {We present a numerical method and computer code to calculate the radiative transfer and excitation of molecular lines. Formulating the Monte Carlo method from the viewpoint of cells rather than photons allows us to separate local and external contributions to the radiation field. This separation is critical to accurate and fast performance at high optical depths (tau >{\textasciitilde} 100). The random nature of the Monte Carlo method serves to verify the independence of the solution to the angular, spatial, and frequency sampling of the radiation field. These features allow use of our method in a wide variety of astrophysical problems without specific adaptations: in any axially symmetric source model and for all atoms or molecules for which collisional rate coefficients are available. Continuum emission and absorption by dust is explicitly taken into account but scattering is neglected. We illustrate these features in calculations of (i) the HCO+ J=1-0 and 3-2 emission from a flattened protostellar envelope with infall and rotation, (ii) the CO, HCO+, CN and HCN emission from a protoplanetary disk and (iii) HCN emission from a high-mass young stellar object, where infrared pumping is important. The program can be used for optical depths up to 103-104, depending on source model. We expect this program to be an important tool in analysing data from present and future infrared and (sub) millimetre telescopes.},

abstract = {Enhancement and spread of helium among globular cluster stars have been recently suggested as a way to explain the horizontal-branch blue tails in those clusters that show a primordial spread in the abundances of C, N, O, and other elements involved in advanced CNO burning. Helium enhancement is unavoidable if the matter responsible for the abundance spreads is identified with the matter lost by massive asymptotic giant branch stars, which evolve during the early phases of globular cluster life, as we noted in 2002. In this paper we examine the implications of the hypothesis that, in many globular clusters, stars were born in two separate events: an initial burst (first generation), which gives origin to probably all high- and intermediate-mass stars and to a fraction of the cluster stars observed today, and a second, prolonged star formation phase (second generation), in which stars form directly from the ejecta of the intermediate-mass stars of the first generation. In particular, we consider in detail the morphology of the horizontal branch in NGC 2808 and argue that it unveils the early cluster evolution, from the birth of the first star generation to the end of the second phase of star formation. This framework provides a feasible interpretation for the still-unexplained dichotomy of the NGC 2808 horizontal branch, attributing the lack of stars in the RR Lyrae region to the gap in the helium content between the red clump, whose stars are considered to belong to the first stellar generation and have primordial helium, and the blue side of the horizontal branch, whose minimum helium content reflects the helium abundance in the smallest progenitor mass ({\textasciitilde}4 Msolar) contributing to the second stellar generation. This scenario provides constraints on the required initial mass function, in such a way that a great many remnant neutron stars and stellar mass black holes might have been produced.},

abstract = {There is a fortuitous coincidence in the positions of the quasar Ton S210 and the compact H I high-velocity cloud CHVC 224.0-83.4-197 on the sky. Using Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer observations of the metal line absorption in this cloud and sensitive H I 21 cm emission observations obtained with the multibeam system at Parkes Observatory, we determine a metallicity of (O/H)<0.46 solar at a confidence of 3 $\sigma$. The metallicity of the high-velocity gas is consistent with either an extragalactic or Magellanic Cloud origin but is not consistent with a location inside the Milky Way unless the chemical history of the gas is considerably different from that of the interstellar medium in the Galactic disk and halo. Combined with measurements of highly ionized species (C III and O VI) at high velocities, this metallicity limit indicates that the cloud has a substantial halo of ionized gas; there is as much ionized gas as neutral gas directly along the Ton S210 sight line. We suggest several observational tests that would improve the metallicity determination substantially and help to distinguish between possible origins for the high-velocity gas. Additional observations of this sight line would be valuable, since the number of compact HVCs positioned in front of background sources bright enough for high-resolution absorption-line studies is extremely limited.},

abstract = {Context: Fast stellar rotation is currently the most promising mechanism for producing primary nitrogen in metal-poor massive stars. Chemical evolution models computed with the inclusion of the yields of fast rotating models at a metallicity Z=10-8 can account for the high N/O abundances observed in normal metal-poor halo stars. If, as believed, intermediate mass stars did not have enough time to contribute to the interstellar medium enrichment at such low metallicities, the above result constitutes a strong case for the existence of fast rotators in the primordial Universe. Aims: An important result of stellar models of fast rotators is that large quantities of primary 13C are produced. Hence, our goal is to investigate the consequence of fast rotation on the evolution of the 12C/13C ratio in the interstellar medium at low metallicity. Methods: We compute the evolution of the 12C/13C ratio for the first time at very low metallicities upon the inclusion of fast rotators at Z= 10-8. Results: We predict that, if fast rotating massive stars were common phenomena in the early Universe, the primordial interstellar medium of galaxies with a star formation history similar to the one inferred for our galactic halo should have 12C/13C ratios between 30-300. Without fast rotators, the predicted 12C/13{C} ratios would be 4500 at [Fe/H] = -3.5, increasing to {\~{ }} 31 000 at around [Fe/H] = -5.0. Current data on very metal-poor giant normal stars in the galactic halo agree better with chemical evolution models including fast rotators. The expected difference in the 12C/13C ratios, after accounting for the effects of the first dredge-up, between our predictions with/without fast rotators is of the order of a factor of 2-3. However, larger differences (a factor of 60{-}90) are expected for giants at [Fe/H]=-5 or turnoff stars already at [Fe/H]=-3.5. To test our predictions, challenging measurements of the 12C/13C in more extremely metal-poor giants and turnoff stars are required.},

abstract = {Chemical abundances in a large and representative sample of galactic H II regions covering a wide range in galactocentric radius RG were measured using radio and optical spectroscopy. Accurate electron temperatures in 67 H II regions spanning the range RG = 3.5-13.7 kpc were determined using radio recombination lines and these temperatures were applied to optical spectra of 33 of the same H II regions in order to determine the abundances of O, N, S, Ne, Ar, and He(+). Among other results, it is found that some H II regions have electron temperatures below 5000 K and that the radio-determined electron temperatures agree well with those obtained from the optical line ratios, in the light of standard models of H II regions. A gradient of H II region electron temperature with distance from the galactic center is found which equals +433 + or - 40 K/kpc, while the oxygen abundance gradient is -0.07 + or - 0.015 dex/kpc. The nitrogen abundance gradient is similar to that of oxygen, -0.09 + or 0.015 dex/kpc, while the sulfur abundance gradient (-0.01 + or - 0.02 dex/kpc) is significantly flatter than that of oxygen. No significant gradient in He(+)/H(+) is detected. In addition, evidence indicates that the abundance gradients may be steeper over the inner regions of the galactic disk.},

abstract = {Aims:Hydrogen-burning is the root cause of the star-to-star abundance variations of light nuclei in Galactic globular clusters (GC). In the present work we constrain the physical conditions that gave rise to the observed abundance patterns of Li, C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, as well as Mg isotopes in the typical case of NGC 6752. Methods: We perform nucleosynthesis calculations at constant temperature, adopting realistic initial abundances for the proto-cluster gas. We use a detailed nuclear reaction network and state-of-the-art nuclear reaction rates. Results: Although simplistic, our analysis provides original results and new constraints on the self-enrichment scenario for GCs. Our parametric calculations allow us to determine a narrow range of temperature where the observed extreme abundances of all light elements and isotopes in NGC 6752 are nicely reproduced simultaneously. This agreement is obtained after mixing of the H-processed material with {\textasciitilde}30 % of unprocessed gas. We show that the observed C-N, O-Na, Mg-Al, Li-Na and F-Na anticorrelations as well as the behaviour of the Mg isotopes can be recovered by assuming mixing with various dilution factors. Li production by the stars that build up the other abundance anomalies is not mandatory in the case of NGC 6752. Conclusions: Observations of O, Na, Mg and Al constrain the temperature range for H-burning; such temperatures are encountered in the two main candidate {\textquotedblleft}polluters{\textquotedblright} proposed for GCs, namely massive AGBs and the most massive main-sequence stars. Furthermore, observations require dilution of H-burning processed material with pristine one. They provide no clue, however, as to the nature of the unprocessed material required for mixing. The complementary observations of the fragile Li and F clearly point to ISM origin for the mixed material.},

abstract = {Context. All globular clusters (GCs) studied in detail host two or more populations of stars (the multiple population phenomenon). Theoretical models suggest that the second population is formed from gas polluted by processed material produced by massive stars of the first generation. However the nature of the polluters is matter of strong debate. Several candidates have been proposed: massive main-sequence stars (fast rotating or binaries), intermediate-mass AGB stars, or SNeII. Aims: We studied red giant branch (RGB) stars in the GC M4 (NGC 6121) to measure their chemical signature. Our goal is to measure abundances for many key elements (from Li to Eu) in order to derive constraints on the polluters responsible for the multiple populations. Methods: We observed 23 RGB stars below the RGB-bump using the GIRAFFE spectroscopic facility installed on VLT2. Spectra cover a wide range and allowed us to measure light (Li, C, 12C/13C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al), $\alpha$ (Si, Ca, Ti), iron-peak (Cr, Fe, Ni), light-s (Y), heavy-s (Ba), and r (Eu) elements. We supplemented this study by analyzing an additional subsample of the UVES spectra in order to gather further clues about light s-elements of different atomic number (Y and Zr). Results: We confirm the presence of a bimodal population. Stars can be easily separated according to their N content. The two groups have different C, 12C/13C, N, O, Na content, but share the same Li, C+N+O, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, Cr, Fe, Ni, Zr, Ba and Eu abundance. Quite surprisingly the two groups differ also in their Y abundance. This result is strongly supported also by the analysis of the UVES spectra. Conclusions: The absence of a spread in $\alpha$-elements, Eu and Ba makes SNeII and AGB stars unlikely as polluters. On the other hand, massive main-sequence stars can explain the bimodality of Y through the weak s-process. This statement is confirmed independently also by literature data on Rb and Pb. The lack of a Mg/Al spread and the extension of the [O/Na] distribution suggest that the mass of the polluters is between 20 and 30 M⊙. This implies a formation time scale for the cluster of 10 {\textdiv} 30 Myr. This result is valid for M4. Other clusters such as NGC 1851, M 22, or $\omega$ Cen have different chemical signatures and may require other kinds of polluters.

abstract = {Context. It has been noted that, in classical extremely metal-poor (EMP) stars, the abundance ratio of two well-observed neutron-capture elements, Sr and Ba, is always higher than [Sr/Ba] = -0.5, which is the value of the solar r-only process; however, a handful of EMP stars have recently been found with a very low Sr/Ba ratio. Aims: We try to understand the origin of this anomaly by comparing the abundance pattern of the elements in these stars and in the classical EMP stars. Methods: For a rigorous comparison with previous data, four stars with very low Sr/Ba ratios were observed and analyzed in the same way as in the First Stars program: analysis within LTE approximation through 1D (hydrostatic) model atmosphere, providing homogeneous abundances of nine neutron-capture elements. Results: In CS 22950-173, the only turnoff star of the sample, the Sr/Ba ratio is, in fact, found to be higher than the r-only solar ratio, so the star is discarded. The remaining stars (CS 29493-090, CS 30322-023, HE 305-4520) are cool evolved giants. They do not present a clear carbon enrichment, but in evolved giants C is partly burned into N, and owing to their high N abundance, they could still have initially been carbon-rich EMP stars (CEMP). The abundances of Na to Mg present similar anomalies to those in CEMP stars. The abundance patterns of the neutron-capture elements in the three stars are strikingly similar to a theoretical s-process pattern. This pattern could at first be attributed to pollution by a nearby AGB, but none of the stars presents a clear variation in the radial velocity indicating the presence of a companion. The stellar parameters seem to exclude any internal pollution in a TP-AGB phase for at least two of these stars. The possibility that the stars are early-AGB stars polluted during the core He flash does not seem compatible with the theory.

abstract = {Context: UV observations of some massive globular clusters have revealed a significant population of very hot stars below the hot end of the horizontal branch (HB), the so-called blue hook stars. This feature might be explained either as a result of the late hot flasher scenario where stars experience the helium flash while on the white dwarf cooling curve or by the progeny of the helium-enriched sub-population recently postulated to exist in some clusters. Previous spectroscopic analyses of blue hook stars in $\omega$ Cen and NGC 2808 support the late hot flasher scenario, but the stars contain much less helium than expected and the predicted C, N enrichment could not be verified. Aims: We compare observed effective temperatures, surface gravities, and abundances of He, C, and N of blue hook and canonical extreme horizontal branch (EHB) star candidates to the predictions of the two scenarios. Methods: Moderately high resolution spectra of stars at the hot end of the blue HB in the globular cluster $\omega$ Cen were analysed for atmospheric parameters and abundances using LTE and non-LTE model atmospheres. Results: In the temperature range 30 000 K to 50 000 K we find that 35% of our stars are helium-poor (log{{n_He}/{n_H}} < -2), 51% have solar helium abundance within a factor of 3 (-1.5 ⪉ log{{n_He}/{n_H}} ⪉ -0.5) and 14% are helium-rich (log{{n_He}/{n_H}} > -0.4). We also find carbon enrichment strongly correlated with helium enrichment, with a maximum carbon enrichment of 3% by mass. Conclusions: At least 14% of the hottest HB stars in $\omega$ Cen show helium abundances well above the highest predictions from the helium enrichment scenario (Y = 0.42 corresponding to log{{n_He}/{n_H}} $\approx$ -0.74). In addition, the most helium-rich stars show strong carbon enrichment, as predicted by the late hot flasher scenario. We conclude that the helium-rich HB stars in $\omega$ Cen cannot be explained solely by the helium-enrichment scenario invoked to explain the blue main sequence.

abstract = {We study the initial mass function (IMF) and hosting halo properties of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs, 104-6 M⊙) formed inside metal-free, UV-illuminated atomic-cooling haloes (virial temperature Tvir $\ge$ 104 K) either via the direct collapse of the gas or via an intermediate supermassive star (SMS) stage. These IMBHs have been recently advocated as the seeds of the supermassive black holes observed at z $\approx$ 6. We achieve this goal in three steps: (a) we derive the gas accretion rate for a proto-SMS to undergo General Relativity instability and produce a direct collapse black hole (DCBH) or to enter the zero-age main sequence and later collapse into an IMBH; (b) we use merger-tree simulations to select atomic-cooling haloes in which either a DCBH or SMS can form and grow, accounting for metal enrichment and major mergers that halt the growth of the proto-SMS by gas fragmentation. We derive the properties of the hosting haloes and the mass distribution of black holes at this stage, and dub it the `birth mass function'; (c) we follow the further growth of the DCBH by accreting the leftover gas in the parent halo and compute the final IMBH mass. We consider two extreme cases in which minihaloes (Tvir < 104 K) can (fertile) or cannot (sterile) form stars and pollute their gas leading to a different IMBH IMF. In the (fiducial) fertile case, the IMF is bimodal extending over a broad range of masses, M $\approx$ (0.5-20) {\texttimes} 105 M⊙, and the DCBH accretion phase lasts from 10 to 100 Myr. If minihaloes are sterile, the IMF spans the narrower mass range M $\approx$ (1-2.8) {\texttimes} 106 M⊙, and the DCBH accretion phase is more extended (70-120 Myr). We conclude that a good seeding prescription is to populate haloes (a) of mass 7.5 < log (Mh/ M⊙) < 8, (b) in the redshift range 8 < z < 17, (c) with IMBH in the mass range 4.75 < (log M{\textbullet}/ M⊙) < 6.25.},

The metal-intermediate (MI) RRL stars ([Fe/H] {\textasciitilde} -1.2) are fainter than the bulk of the dominant metal-poor population ([Fe/H] {\textasciitilde} -1.7), in good agreement with the corresponding zero-age horizontal-branch models with cosmological helium abundance Y = 0.246. This result conflicts with the hypothesis that the progenitors of the MI RRL stars correspond to the anomalous blue main-sequence stars, which share a similar metallicity but whose properties are currently explained by assuming for them a large helium enhancement. Therefore, in this scenario, the coexistence within the cluster of two different populations with similar metallicities ([Fe/H] {\textasciitilde} -1.2) and different helium abundances has to be considered.},

Using SDSS-II/SEGUE spectra of over 1900 G- and K-type halo giants, we identify for the first time a subset of stars with CN bandstrengths significantly larger, and CH bandstrengths lower, than the majority of halo field stars, at fixed temperature and metallicity. Since CN bandstrength inhomogeneity and the usual attendant abundance variations are presently understood as a result of star formation in globular clusters, we interpret this subset of halo giants as a result of globular cluster dissolution into the Galactic halo. We find that 2.5% of our sample is CN-strong, and can infer based on recent models of globular cluster evolution that the fraction of halo field stars initially formed within globular clusters may be as large as 50%.},

abstract = {The double main sequence identified in the globular cluster Omega Centauri has been interpreted using isochrones to indicate a large variation in the abundance of helium. If true, a helium enhancement carries strong implications for the chemical and stellar evolutionary history of this cluster. However, only indirect measures currently support this conjecture. We report the discovery of a variation in the line strength of the near-infrared He I 10830 {\AA} transition in 12 similar red giants in Omega Centauri observed with PHOENIX on Gemini-S. Abundances of these stars derived from Magellan/MIKE spectra taken at the Las Campanas Observatory show that the helium transition is not detected in the most metal-poor population ([Fe/H] < -1.8), yet is present in the majority of stars with [Fe/H] >= -1.8. These observations give the first direct evidence for an enhancement of helium in Omega Centauri. The appearance of helium appears better correlated with increased [Al/Fe] and [Na/Fe] abundances than as a function of [Fe/H], giving observational support to the presence of high-temperature H burning in a prior generation of stars. Data presented herein were obtained at the Gemini Observatory, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under a cooperative agreement with the NSF on behalf of the Gemini partnership: the National Science Foundation (United States), the Science and Technology Facilities Council (United Kingdom), the National Research Council (Canada), CONICYT (Chile), the Australian Research Council (Australia), Minist{\'e}rio da Ci{\^e}ncia e Tecnologia (Brazil), and Ministerio de Ciencia, Tecnolog{\'\i}a e Innovaci{\'o}n Productiva (Argentina).

abstract = {The sun and giant planets are generally thought to have the same helium abundance as that in the solar nebula from which they were formed 4.6 billion years ago. In contrast, the interstellar medium reflects current galactic conditions. The departure of current abundances from the primordial and protosolar values may help trace the processes that drive the nucleosynthesis evolution of the galaxy and planetary interior formation and evolution. The Galileo probe measured the He abundance in situ the atmosphere of Jupiter, showing that He is only slightly depleted compared to the solar value. For Saturn, contradictory estimates from past Voyager observations make its He abundance very uncertain. Here, we use He 58.4 nm dayglow measured from the outer planets by the Voyager ultraviolet spectrometers to derive the He abundance in the atmosphere of Jupiter and Saturn. With the He abundance reported here, credible models become possible for the interior of Jupiter, Saturn, and extrasolar planets. We also use the solar He 58.4 nm line measured by the Solar Heliospheric Observatory to derive the He abundance inside the focusing cone. Finally, we compare He abundances derived here with primordial and protosolar values, stressing the unique opportunity offered by inner heliosphere observations and future Voyager in situ local interstellar medium measurements to derive the He abundance in the very interstellar cloud in which we reside.},

This has been modeled in previous multi-dimensional simulations. However, at late stages of the explosion, the flame will propagate in the so-called distributed regime.

abstract = {The structure of stars with massive envelopes (Menv $\ge$ 14 Msun) and degenerate neutron cores is discussed. In such stars, most of the luminosity arises from thermonuclear reactions taking place at the base of the convective envelope. The proton-rich material in this region, continuously linked to the outer regions by convection, provides an ideal site for the rp-process. In addition, material may repeatedly pass through the burning zone, with large intervals between each passage, allowing the formation of heavy nuclei up to A {\~{ }} 150. Evolutionary calculations are presented of the structure of such stars and of the nucleosynthesis in their envelopes. A lower mass limit of 14 Msun is found for stars of this type. Assuming a lifetime of $\ge$ 105 yr, a significant fraction, {\~{ }}5 per cent, of the envelope mass is converted to metals beyond iron, and, for a restricted range of masses (depending on the somewhat uncertain details of envelope convection), some of the p-nuclei are produced in relative abundances reminiscent of those found for the Solar system. The abundance peak at molybdenum is, however, not reproduced. If Thorne-{\.{Z}}ytkow objects are a later stage in the evolution of massive X-ray binaries then, even if only a small fraction of Thorne-{\.{Z}}ytkow objects produce the more massive p-nuclei, the progenitor population is sufficiently large to account for the observed abundances of some of these nuclei.},

Neutrinos excite heavy elements and even helium to particle unbound levels. The evaporation of a single neutron or proton, and the back reaction of these nucleons on other species present, significantly alters the outcome of traditional nucleosynthesis calculations leading to a new process: nu-nucleosynthesis. Modifications to traditional hydrostatic and explosive varieties of helium, carbon, neon, oxygen, and silicon burning are considered. The results show that a large number of rare isotopes, including many of the odd-Z nuclei from boron through copper, owe much of their present abundance in nature to this process.},

abstract = {Heavy elements, those produced by neutron-capture reactions, have traditionally shown no star-to-star dispersion in all but a handful of metal-poor globular clusters (GCs). Recent detections of low [Pb/Eu] ratios or upper limits in several metal-poor GCs indicate that the heavy elements in these GCs were produced exclusively by an r-process. Re-examining GC heavy element abundances from the literature, we find unmistakable correlations between the [La/Fe] and [Eu/Fe] ratios in four metal-poor GCs (M5, M15, M92, and NGC 3201), only two of which were known previously. This indicates that the total r-process abundances vary from star to star (by factors of 2-6) relative to Fe within each GC. We also identify potential dispersion in two other GCs (M3 and M13). Several GCs (M12, M80, and NGC 6752) show no evidence of r-process dispersion. The r-process dispersion is not correlated with the well-known light element dispersion, indicating that it was present in the gas throughout the duration of star formation. The observations available at present suggest that star-to-star r-process dispersion within metal-poor GCs may be a common but not ubiquitous phenomenon that is neither predicted by nor accounted for in current models of GC formation and evolution.},

abstract = {We present a comprehensive theoretical investigation of the evolutionary properties of intermediate-mass stars. The evolutionary sequences were computed from the zero-age main sequence up to the central He exhaustion and often up to the phases that precede the carbon ignition or to the reignition of the H-shell, which marks the beginning of the thermal pulse phase. The evolutionary tracks were constructed by adopting a wide range of stellar masses (3<=M/Msolar <=15) and chemical compositions. In order to account for current uncertainties on the He to heavy elements enrichment ratio ($\Delta$Y/$\Delta$Z), the stellar models were computed by adopting at Z=0.02 two different He contents (Y=0.27, 0.289) and at Z=0.04 three different He contents (Y=0.29, 0.34, and 0.37). Moreover, to supply a homogeneous evolutionary scenario that accounts for young Magellanic stellar systems the calculations were also extended toward lower metallicities (Z=0.004, Z=0.01), by adopting different initial He abundances. We evaluated for both solar (Z=0.02) and super-metal-rich (SMR, Z=0.04) models the transition mass Mup between the stellar structures igniting carbon and those that develop a full electron degeneracy inside the carbon-oxygen core. We found that Mup is of the order of 7.7+/-0.5 Msolar for solar composition, while for SMR structures an increase in the He content causes a decrease in Mup, and indeed it changes from 9.5+/-0.5 Msolar at Y=0.29, to 8.7+/-0.2 Msolar at Y=0.34, and to 7.7+/-0.2 Msolar at Y=0.37. We also show that Mup presents a nonlinear behavior with metallicity, and indeed it decreases when moving from Z=0.04 to Z{\textasciitilde}0.001 and increases at lower metal contents. This finding confirms the predictions by Cassisi {\&} Castellani and more recently by Umeda et al. and suggests that the rate of SNe type Ia depends on the chemical composition of the parent stellar population. This approach allows us to investigate in detail the evolutionary properties of classical Cepheids. In particular, we find that the range of stellar masses that perform the blue loop during the central He-burning phase narrows when moving toward metal-rich and SMR structures. This evidence and the substantial decrease in the evolutionary time spent by these structures inside the instability strip bring out that the probability of detecting long-period Cepheids in SMR stellar systems is substantially smaller than in more metal-poor systems. Moreover, and even more important, we find that the time spent by Cepheids along the subsequent crossings of the instability strip also depends on the stellar mass. In fact, our models suggest that low-mass, metal-poor Cepheids spend a substantial portion of their lifetime along the blueward excursion of the blue loop, while at higher masses (M/Msolar>=8) the time spent along the redward excursion becomes longer. Models at solar chemical composition present an opposite behavior, i.e., the time spent along the redward excursion is longer than the blueward excursion among low-mass Cepheids and vice versa for high-mass Cepheids. Oddly enough, the time spent along the blueward excursion is for models at Z=0.01 longer than the redward excursion over the entire mass range. This suggests a nonlinear dependence of crossing times on metallicity. The time spent along the first crossing of the instability strip is generally negligible with the exception of high-mass, metal-poor stellar structures for which it becomes of the order of 15%-20% of the total crossing time.},

abstract = {We analyse orbits of stars and dark matter out to three effective radii for 42 galaxies formed in cosmological zoom simulations. Box orbits always dominate at the centres and z-tubes become important at larger radii. We connect the orbital structure to the formation histories and specific features (e.g. disc, counter-rotating core, minor axis rotation) in two-dimensional kinematic maps. Globally, fast-rotating galaxies with significant recent in situ star formation are dominated by z-tubes. Slow rotators with recent mergers have significant box orbit and x-tube components. Rotation, quantified by the $\lambda$R-parameter often originates from streaming motion of stars on z-tubes but sometimes from figure rotation. The observed anticorrelation of h3 and V0/$\sigma$ in rotating galaxies can be connected to a dissipative formation history leading to high z-tube fractions. For galaxies with recent mergers in situ formed stars, accreted stars and dark matter particles populate similar orbits. Dark matter particles have isotropic velocity dispersions. Accreted stars are typically radially biased ($\beta$ $\approx$ 0.2-0.4). In situ stars become tangentially biased (as low as $\beta$ $\approx$ -1.0) if dissipation was relevant during the late assembly of the galaxy. We discuss the relevance of our analysis for integral field surveys and for constraining galaxy formation models.},

The $\omega$ Cen stars sample both the "primordial" (i.e., O-rich, Na- and Al-poor) and the "extreme" (O-depleted, Na- and Al-rich) populations in the cluster. The primordial population stars in both $\omega$ Cen and M4 show (25Mg, 26Mg)/24Mg isotopic ratios that are consistent with those found for the primordial population in other globular clusters with similar [Fe/H] values. The isotopic ratios for the $\omega$ Cen extreme stars are also consistent with those for extreme population stars in other clusters. The results for the extreme population stars studied indicate that the 26Mg/24Mg ratio is highest at intermediate metallicities ([Fe/H] < -1.4 dex), and for the highest [Al/Fe] values. Further, the relative abundance of 26Mg in the extreme population stars is notably higher than that of 25Mg, in contrast to model predictions. The 25Mg/24Mg isotopic ratio in fact does not show any obvious dependence on either [Fe/H] or [Al/Fe] nor, intriguingly, any obvious difference between the primordial and extreme population stars.},

abstract = {Recent observations have revealed that Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are not perfect standard candles; they show variations in their absolute magnitudes, light-curve shapes, and spectra. The C/O ratio in the SNe Ia progenitors (C-O white dwarfs) may be related to this variation. In this work, we systematically investigate the effects of stellar mass (M) and metallicity (Z) on the C/O ratio and its distribution in the C-O white dwarfs by calculating stellar evolution from the main sequence through the end of the second dredge-up for M=3-9 Msolar and Z=0.001-0.03. We find that the total carbon mass fraction just before SN Ia explosion varies in the range 0.36-0.5. We also calculate the metallicity dependence of the main-sequence mass range of the SN Ia progenitor white dwarfs. Our results show that the maximum main-sequence mass to form C-O white dwarfs decreases significantly toward lower metallicity, and the number of SN Ia progenitors may be underestimated if metallicity effect is neglected. We discuss the implications of these results on the variation of SNe Ia, determination of cosmological parameters, luminosity function of white dwarfs, and galactic chemical evolution.},

Comparing pulsation properties of detected objects we find that they constitute two groups with clearly distinct features. In this paper we analyze in detail small amplitude variable red giants (about 15400 and 3000 objects in the LMC and SMC, respectively). The vast majority of these objects are multi-periodic. At least 30% of them exhibit two modes closely spaced in the power spectrum, what likely indicates non-radial oscillations. About 50% exhibit additional so called Long Secondary Period. To distinguish between AGB and RGB red giants we compare PL diagrams of multi-periodic red giants located above and below the tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB). The giants above the TRGB form four parallel ridges in the PL diagram. Among much more numerous sample of giants below the TRGB we find objects located on the low luminosity extensions of these ridges, but most of the stars are located on the ridges slightly shifted in log P. We interpret the former as the second ascent AGB red giants and the latter as the first ascent RGB objects. Thus, we empirically show that the pulsating red giants fainter than the TRGB are a mixture of RGB and AGB giants. Finally, we compare the Petersen diagrams of the LMC, SMC and Galactic bulge variable red giants and find that they are basically identical indicating that the variable red giants in all these different stellar environments share similar pulsation properties.},

With these abundances, the new solar metallicity, Z, and Z/X, decrease to Z = 0.012 and Z/X = 0.0165 respectively, almost a factor of 2 lower than earlier widely used values.

abstract = {Sakurai's Object is a born again AGB star of the very late thermal pulse flavor. In this contribution I will discuss new models of stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis models of this phase. Two most intriguing properties of Sakurai's Object have so far not been understood theoretically: the peculiar chemical appearance, in particular the high lithium abundance, and the short time scale of only a few years on which the transition from the dwarf configuration into the born again giant appearance has occurred. A new nucleosynthesis mode of hot hydrogen-deficient ^3He burning can explain the extraordinary lithium abundance. During the thermal pulse ^3He is ingested from the envelope together with the protons into the hot He-flash convection zone. The first network calculations show that, due to the large ^12C abundance protons are captured rather by carbon, than destroy newly formed ^7Be and ultimately ^7Li. Moreover, the short evolution time scale has been reproduced by making the assumption that the convective efficiency for element mixing is smaller by two to three orders of magnitude than predicted by the mixing-length theory. As a result the main energy generation from fast convective proton capture will occur at a larger mass coordinate, closer to the surface and the expansion to the giant state is accelerated to a few years, in excellent agreement with the behavior of Sakurai's Object. This result represents an independent empirical constraint on the poorly known efficiency of element mixing in convective zones of the stellar interior.},

abstract = {A critical comparison is made between the results of s-process nucleosynthesis obtained with the phenomenological classical approach and a stellar model for helium shell burning in low-mass stars. For the first time, close agreement is found between the abundances determined by the classical analysis and the results of a stellar model. The calculated abundances are found in good agreement with the s-process yields observed in solar material, and the corresponding quantities characterizing the neutron exposure are outlined in detail. Emphasis is laid on the information deduced from the abundance patterns in s-process branchings, i.e., neutron density and temperature. Despite the conceptual differences between the steady flow approximation of the classical approach and the dynamical environment of thermal pulses in low-mass stars, the results of both models are quite similar, but still obscured by the present uncertainties of the nuclear input data; further improvements are required to quantify the trends of the true physical conditions during the s-process which start to emerge from the above studies.},

The model includes four interior equations of a nonrotating, quasi-static star and four boundary conditions.

The higher order truncation error is obtained by using the Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg method (1970) to generate fourth- and fifth-order approximations. The truncation error is then the difference between the approximations, and has proven useful for avoiding the appearance of an excessive number of shells in computations.},

abstract = {Context. This paper is part of a larger project in which we want to focus on the still poorly understood asymptotic giant branch (AGB) third dredge-up processes and associated s-process nucleosynthesis. Aims: We confront accurate spectral abundance analyses of post-AGB stars in both the Magellanic Clouds, to state-of-the-art AGB model predictions. With this comparison we aim at improving our understanding of the 3rd dredge-up phenomena and their dependencies on initial mass and metallicity. Methods: Because of the well constrained distance with respect to Galactic post-AGB stars, we choose an extra-galactic post-AGB star for this contribution, namely the only known 21 $\mu$m object of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC): J004441.04-732136.4. We used optical UVES spectra to perform an accurate spectral abundance analysis. With photometric data of multiple catalogues we construct a spectral energy distribution (SED) and perform a variability analysis. The results are then compared to predictions of tailored theoretical chemical AGB evolutionary models for which we used two evolution codes. Results: Spectral abundance results reveal J004441.04-732136.4 to be one of the most s-process enriched objects found up to date, while the photospheric C/O ratio of 1.9 {\textpm} 0.7, shows the star is only modestly C-rich. J004441.04-732136.4 also displays a low [Fe/H] = -1.34 {\textpm} 0.32, which is significantly lower than the mean metallicity of the SMC. From the SED, a luminosity of 7600 {\textpm} 200 L⊙ is found, together with E(B - V) = 0.64 {\textpm} 0.02. According to evolutionary post-AGB tracks, the initial mass should be $\approx$1.3 M⊙. The photometric variability shows a clear period of 97.6 {\textpm} 0.3 days. The detected C/O as well as the high s-process overabundances (e.g. [Y/Fe] = 2.15, [La/Fe] = 2.84) are hard to reconcile with the predictions. The chemical models also predict a high Pb abundance, which is not compatible with the detected spectrum, and a very high 12C/13C, which is not yet constrained by observations. The predictions are only marginally dependent on the evolution codes used. Conclusions: By virtue of their spectral types, favourable bolometric corrections as well as their constrained distances, post-AGB stars in external galaxies offer unprecedented tests to AGB nucleosynthesis and dredge-up predictions. We focus here on one object J004441.04-732136.4, which is the only known 21 $\mu$m source of the SMC. We show that our theoretical predictions match the s-process distribution, but fail in reproducing the detected high overabundances and predict a high Pb abundance which is not detected. Additionally, there remain serious problems in explaining the observed pulsational properties of this source.

The values of [N/Fe] ratio were obtained by comparing the flux measured in the observed spectra with that from synthetic spectra for up to about 15 features of CN. This is the first time that N abundances are obtained for such a large sample of RGB stars from medium-resolution spectroscopy in this cluster. With these abundances, we provide chemical tagging of the split RGB found from several studies in NGC 1851. The secondary reddest sequence on the RGB is populated almost exclusively by N-rich stars, confirming our previous suggestion based on Str{\"o}mgren magnitudes and colours. These giants are also, on average, enriched in s-process elements such as Ba, and are likely the results of pollution from low-mass stars that experienced episodes of third dredge-up in the asymptotic giant branch phase.

abstract = {The standard model for the operation of the s-process in asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars predicts that low-metallicity ([Fe/H] <{\textasciitilde} -1) AGB stars should exhibit large overabundances of Pb and Bi as compared to other s-elements. The discovery of the first three such ``lead stars'' (defined as stars enriched in s-elements with [Pb/hs] >{\textasciitilde} 1, hs being any of Ba, La or Ce) among CH stars has been reported in a previous paper (Van Eck et al. \cite{VanEck-01}). Five more CH stars (with [Fe/H] ranging from -1.5 to -2.5) are studied in the present paper, and two of them appear to be enriched in lead (with [Pb/Ce] ={\textasciitilde} 0.7). The Pb I line at lambda4057 .812 {\AA} is detected and clearly resolved thanks to high-resolution spectra (R = lambda /Delta lambda = 135ts000 ). The abundances for these two stars (HD 198269 and HD 201626) are consistent with the predictions for the s-process operating in low-metallicity AGB stars as a consequence of the ``partial mixing'' of protons below the convective hydrogen envelope. Another two stars (HD 189711 and V Ari) add to a growing number of low-metallicity stars (also including LP 625-44 and LP 706-7, as reported by Aoki et al. \cite{Aoki2001}) which do not conform to these predictions. Variations on the canonical proton-mixing scenario for the operation of the s-process in low-metallicity stars, that could account for these discrepant stars, are briefly discussed. Based on observations carried out at the European Southern Observatory (La Silla, Chile; Program 65.L-0354) and at the Observatoire de Haute Provence (operated by CNRS, France).},

abstract = {We present the detection of sodium absorption in the atmosphere of the extrasolar planet WASP-17b, an inflated 'hot Jupiter' in a tight orbit around an F6 dwarf. In-transit observations of WASP-17 made with the Magellan Inamori Kyocera Echelle (MIKE) spectrograph on the 6.5-m Magellan Telescope were analysed for excess planetary atmospheric absorption in the Na I 'D' doublet spectral region. Using the interstellar sodium absorption lines as reference, we detect a 0.58 {\textpm} 0.13 per cent transit signal, with 4.5$\sigma$ confidence, at 1.5 {\AA} bandwidth around the stellar sodium absorption feature. This result is consistent with the previous Very Large Telescope detection of sodium in WASP-17b, confirming that the planet has a highly inflated atmosphere. This paper includes data gathered with the 6.5 metre Magellan Telescopes located at Las Campanas Observatory, Chile.},

abstract = {We present fluorine abundances in seven red giant members of the globular cluster M4 (NGC 6121). These abundances were derived from the HF (1-0) R9 line at 2.3357 $\mu$m in high-resolution infrared spectra obtained with the Phoenix spectrograph on the Gemini South telescope. Many abundances in the target stars have been studied previously, so their overall abundance distributions are well mapped. The abundance of fluorine is found to vary by more than a factor of 6, with the 19F variations being correlated with the already established oxygen variations and anticorrelated with the sodium and aluminium variations. In this paper we thus add fluorine to the list of elements known to vary in globular cluster stars, and this provides further evidence that H burning is the root cause of the chemical inhomogeneities. The fact that 19F is found to decrease in the M4 stars, as the signature of H burning appears, indicates that the polluting stars must have masses greater than about 3.5 Msolar, as less massive stars than this should produce, not destroy, fluorine.},

abstract = {We present Mg isotope ratios in four red giants of the globular cluster M13 and one red giant of the globular cluster M71 based on high-resolution, high signal-to-noise ratio spectra obtained with HDS on the Subaru Telescope. We confirm earlier results by Shetrone that for M13 the ratio varies from (25Mg+26Mg)/24Mg{\textasciitilde}=1 in stars with the highest Al abundance to (25Mg+26Mg)/24Mg{\textasciitilde}=0.2 in stars with the lowest Al abundance. However, we separate the contributions of all three isotopes and find a considerable spread in the ratio 24Mg:25Mg:26Mg, with values ranging from 48:13:39 to 78:11:11. As in NGC 6752, we find a positive correlation between 26Mg and Al, an anticorrelation between 24Mg and Al, and no correlation between 25Mg and Al. In M71, our one star has a Mg isotope ratio of 70:13:17. For both clusters, even the lowest ratios of 25Mg/24Mg and 26Mg/24Mg exceed those observed in field stars at the same metallicity, a result also found in NGC 6752. The contribution of 25Mg to the total Mg abundance is constant within a given cluster and between clusters with 25Mg/(24Mg+25Mg+26Mg){\textasciitilde}=0.13. For M13 and NGC 6752, the ranges of the Mg isotope ratios are similar and both clusters show the same correlations between Al and Mg isotopes, suggesting that the same process is responsible for the abundance variations in these clusters. While existing models fail to reproduce all the observed abundances, we continue to favor the scenario in which two generations of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars produce the observed abundances. A first generation of metal-poor AGB stars pollutes the entire cluster and is responsible for the large ratios of 25Mg/24Mg and 26Mg/24Mg observed in cluster stars with compositions identical to field stars at the same metallicity. Differing degrees of pollution by a second generation of AGB stars of the same metallicity as the cluster provides the star-to-star scatter in Mg isotope ratios.

abstract = {There exists an inverse relationship between the relative abundance of nuclear species in the universe and the neutron-capture cross sections of these nuclei. Abundant nuclei have small capture cross sections, and vice versa. On the basis of this correlation, a non-equilibrium theory of the formation of the elements is developed in which the elements are built up by a process of successive neutron captures. The coefficients in the equations of this theory involve the neutron-capture cross sections of the elements, and for this reason relationships between capture cross sections, atomic weights, and neutron energies are obtained from available data. According to this theory, the primordial material was a gas of neutrons only. As the universe expanded, neutrons decayed to protons and electrons; the capture of neutrons by protons then led to deuterons. These nuclei in turn captured neutrons, and progressively heavier nuclei were formed. The neutron content in these nuclei was controlled by beta-decay between successive neutron captures. The physical conditions which are indicated for the period of element formation are inconsistent with a cosmological model of the early stages of the universe based on matter only. It appears that the early stage was probably a universe of radiation with a trace of matter present. According to this picture, the element-building process began some 200 to 300 seconds after the start of the expansion, at which time the temperature was of the order of 109{\textdegree}K, and the density of matter was of the order of 10-3 g/cm3. Because of the expansion of the universe, and because of the decay of neutrons, the production of elements must have been essentially complete in a time of the order of magnitude of the neutron decay lifetime. Preliminary calculations based on this theory successfully predict the observed relative abundance data.},

abstract = {Context. Overall spherically symmetric, geometrically thin gas and dust shells have been found around a handful of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) carbon stars. Their dynamical ages lie in the range of 103 to 104 years. A tentative explanation for their existence is that they have formed as a consequence of mass-loss-rate modulations during a He-shell flash. Aims: The detached shells carry information on their formation process, as well as on the small-scale structure of the circumstellar medium around AGB stars due to the absence of significant line-of-sight confusion. Methods: The youngest detached shells, those around the carbon stars R Scl and U Cam, are studied here in great detail in scattered stellar light with the Advanced Survey Camera on the Hubble Space Telescope. Quantitative results are derived assuming optically thin dust scattering. Results: The detached dust shells around R Scl and U Cam are found to be consistent with an overall spherical symmetry. They have radii of 19.2 arcsec (corresponding to a linear size of 8 {\texttimes} 1016 cm) and 7.7 arcsec (5 {\texttimes} 1016 cm), widths of 1.2 arcsec (5 {\texttimes} 1015 cm) and 0.6 arcsec (4 {\texttimes} 1015 cm), and dust masses of 3 {\texttimes} 10-6 and 3 {\texttimes} 10-7 M_⊙, respectively. The dynamical ages of the R Scl and U Cam shells are estimated to be 1700 and 700 yr, respectively, and the shell widths correspond to time scales of 100 and 50 yr, respectively. Small-scale structure in the form of less than arcsec-sized clumps is clearly seen in the images of the R Scl shell. Average clump dust masses are estimated to be about 2 {\texttimes} 10-9 M_⊙. Comparisons with CO line interferometer data show that the dust and gas shells coincide spatially, within the errors ($\le$1{\textasciiacute}{\textasciiacute} for U Cam and $\approx$2{\textasciiacute}{\textasciiacute} for R Scl). Conclusions: The results are consistent with the interpretation of geometrically thin gas and dust shells formed by a mass-loss eruption during a He-shell flash, and where interaction with a previous wind plays a role as well. The mass loss responsible for the shells must have been remarkably isotropic, and, if wind interaction plays a role, this also applies to the mass loss prior to the eruption. Clumpy structure is present in the R Scl shell, possibly as a consequence of the mass loss itself, but more likely as a consequence of instabilities in the expanding shell.

abstract = {Rubidium abundances are determined from the Rb 1 7800 A line via synthetic spectra for a sample of M, MS, and S giants. The Rb abundance increases with increasing s-process enrichment. A ratio Rb/Sr ≃ 0.05 is derived for the s-processed material from the He-burning shell. Thanks to the branch in the s-process path at 85Kr the Rb/Sr ratio may be used to determine the neutron density at the time of s-processing. The derived ratio is consistent with predicted neutron densities for operation of the s-process during the interpulse intervals in low-mass asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars but clearly inconsistent with much higher neutron densities predicted for the running of the s-process in the He-shell thermal pulses of intermediate mass AGB stars and probably also of low-mass AGB stars. Zirconium isotopic abundances are determined from ZrO bandheads near 6925 {\AA} via synthetic spectra for a sample of S stars. No evidence is found for the isotope 96Zr whose synthesis is controlled by the branch in the s-process path at 95Zr. This observation shows that the observed stars are not intermediate mass stars with massive (MC ≳ 1 Msun) cores. The absence of 96Zr sets an upper limit on the neutron density at the s-process site which is higher than and, therefore, consistent with the limit set by the Rb abundances in related stars.},

abstract = {Nucleosynthesis beyond Fe poses additional challenges not encountered when studying astrophysical processes involving light nuclei. Generally higher temperatures and nuclear level densities lead to stronger contributions of transitions on excited target states. This may prevent cross section measurements to determine stellar reaction rates and theory contributions remain important. Furthermore, measurements often are not feasible in the astrophysically relevant energy range. Sensitivity analysis allows not only to determine the contributing nuclear properties but also is a handy tool for experimentalists to interpret the impact of their data on predicted cross sections and rates. It can also speed up future input variation studies of nucleosynthesis by simplifying an intermediate step in the full calculation sequence. Large-scale predictions of sensitivities and ground-state contributions to the stellar rates are presented, allowing an estimate of how well rates can be directly constrained by experiment. The reactions 185W(n,gamma) and 186W(gamma,n) are discussed as application examples. Studies of uncertainties in abundances predicted in nucleosynthesis simulations rely on the knowledge of reaction rate errors. An improved treatment of uncertainty analysis is presented as well as a recipe for combining experimental data and theory to arrive at a new reaction rate and its uncertainty. As an example, it is applied to neutron capture rates for the s-process, leading to larger uncertainties than previously assumed.},

abstract = {We present new measurements of the velocity dispersions of 11 Local Group globular clusters using spatially integrated spectra, to expand our sample of clusters with precise integrated-light velocity dispersions to 29, over 4 different host galaxies. This sample allows us to further our investigation of the stellar mass function among clusters, with a particular emphasis on a search for the driver of the apparent bimodal nature of the inferred stellar initial mass function (IMF). We confirm our previous result that clusters fall into two classes. If, as we argue, this behavior reflects a variation in the stellar IMF, the cause of that variation is not clear. The variations do not correlate with formation epoch as quantified by age, metallicity quantified by [Fe/H], host galaxy, or internal structure as quantified by velocity dispersion, physical size, relaxation time, or luminosity. The stellar mass-to-light ratios, Upsilon*, of the high and low Upsilon* cluster populations are well-matched to those found in recent studies of early and late type galaxies, respectively.},

abstract = {Context. Knowing how the mass loss of carbon-rich AGB stars depends on stellar parameters is crucial for stellar evolution modelling, as well as for the understanding of when and how circumstellar structures emerge around these stars, e.g., dust shells and so-called detached shells of expelled gas. Aims: The purpose of this paper is to explore the stellar parameter space using a numerical radiation hydrodynamic (RHD) model of carbon-star atmospheres, including a detailed description of dust formation and frequency-dependent radiative transfer, in order to determine how the mass loss of carbon stars changes with stellar parameters. Methods: We have computed a grid of 900 numeric dynamic model atmospheres (DMAs) using a well-tested computer code. This grid of models covers most of the expected combinations of stellar parameters, which are made up of the stellar temperature, the stellar luminosity, the stellar mass, the abundance of condensible carbon, and the velocity amplitude of the pulsation. Results: The resultant mass-loss rates and wind speeds are clearly affected by the choice of stellar temperature, mass, luminosity and the abundance of available carbon. In certain parts of the parameter space there is also an inevitable mass-loss threshold, below which a dust-driven wind is not possible. Contrary to some previous studies, we find a strong dependence on the abundance of free carbon, which turns out to be a critical parameter. Furthermore, we have found that the dust grains that form in the atmosphere may grow too large for the commonly used small particle approximation of the dust opacity to be strictly valid. This may have some bearing on the wind properties, although further study of this problem is needed before quantitative conclusions can be drawn. Conclusions: The wind properties show relatively simple dependences on stellar parameters above the mass-loss threshold, while the threshold itself is of a more complicated nature. Hence, we chose not to derive any simplistic mass-loss formula, but rather provide a mass-loss prescription in the form of an easy-to-use FORTRAN routine (available at http://coolstars.astro.uu.se). Since this mass-loss routine is based on data coming from an essentially self-consistent model of mass loss, it may therefore serve as a better mass-loss prescription for stellar evolution calculations than empirical formulae. Furthermore, we conclude that there are still some issues that need to be investigated, such as the r{\^o}le of grain-sizes.

These rates are several orders of magnitude lower than the rate of core-collapse supernovae, suggesting that the evolution leading to an HN/GRB requires special circumstances, very likely due to binary interactions. Various possible binary channels are discussed, and it is shown that these are generally compatible with the inferred rates.},

abstract = {Context. The advent of space-borne missions such as CoRoT or Kepler providing photometric data has brought new possibilities for asteroseismology across the H-R diagram. Solar-like oscillations are now observed in many stars, including red giants and main-sequence stars. Aims: Based on several hundred identified pulsating red giants, we aim to characterize their oscillation amplitudes and widths. These observables are compared with those of main-sequence stars in order to test trends and scaling laws for these parameters for main-sequence stars and red giants. Methods: An automated fitting procedure is used to analyze several hundred Fourier spectra. For each star, a modeled spectrum is fitted to the observed oscillation spectrum, and mode parameters are derived. Results: Amplitudes and widths of red-giant solar-like oscillations are estimated for several hundred modes of oscillation. Amplitudes are relatively high (several hundred ppm) and widths relatively small (very few tenths of a $\mu$Hz). Conclusions: Widths measured in main-sequence stars show a different variation with the effective temperature from red giants. A single scaling law is derived for mode amplitudes of red giants and main-sequence stars versus their luminosity to mass ratio. However, our results suggest that two regimes may also be compatible with the observations.

abstract = {In Paper 1 of this series we presented a model to calculate in a synthetic way the evolution of thermal-pulsing asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. The model was applied to the large magellanic cloud (LMC) and values were derived for the minimum core mass for third dredge-up and the dredge-up efficiency. In Paper 1 mass loss on the AGB was parameterized with a Reimers mass loss law with a best-fit value for the coefficient etaAGB of 5. In Paper 2 we showed that the best fitting model of Paper 1 could also reproduce the observed abundance patterns in planetary nebulae (PNe) in the LMC, under the assumption that there is no dredge-up after hot bottom burning (HBB) ceases. To investigate the sensitivity of the results in Papers 1 and 2 to the adopted mass loss law we repeat in this paper the analysis of Papers 1 and 2 for two recently proposed mass loss laws, viz. that of Vassiliadis {\&} Wood (1993, VW) and that of Blocker 7 Schoenberner (1993, BS). We find that the BS-law with a scaling factor etaBS = 0.1 fits all observational constraints equally well as the Reimers law. For the VW-law no combination of parameters could be found that fits all constraints simultaneously. This is probably due to the extreme luminosity dependence (M(dot) approximately Lalpha, alpha = 6) implied by the VW-law. We conclude that synthetic AGB models with mass loss laws that are moderately luminosity dependent) 1 less than alpha less than or approximately 4) can be made to fit all presently available observational constraints.},

abstract = {Globular clusters (GCs) are generally treated as natural validators of simple stellar population (SSP) models. However, there are still some differences between real GCs and SSPs. In this work, we use a direct N-body simulation code NBODY6 to study the influences of dynamical interactions, metallicity and primordial binaries on Milky Way GCs' integrated properties. Our models start with N = 100 000 stars, covering a metallicity range Z = 0.0001 {\~{ }} 0.02, a subset of our models contain primordial binaries, resulting in a binary fraction as currently observed at a model age of GCs. Stellar evolution and external tidal field representative for an average Milky Way GC are taken into consideration. The integrated colours and Lick indices are calculated using BaSeL and Bluered stellar spectral libraries separately. By including dynamical interactions, our model clusters show integrated features (i.e. colours up to 0.01 mag bluer, H$\beta$ up to 0.1 {\AA} greater and [MgFe]' 0.05 {\AA} smaller) making the clusters appear slightly younger than the model clusters without dynamical interactions. This effect is caused mainly by the preferential loss of low-mass stars which have a stronger contribution to redder passbands as well as different spectral features compared to higher mass stars. In addition, this effect is larger at lower metallicities. On the contrary, the incorporation of primordial binaries reduces this effect.},

abstract = {We provide an individual analysis of 94 carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars showing an s-process enrichment (CEMP-s) collected from the literature. The s-process enhancement observed in these stars is ascribed to mass transfer by stellar winds in a binary system from a more massive companion evolving faster towards the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase. The theoretical AGB nucleosynthesis models have been presented in Bisterzo et al. (Paper I of this series). Several CEMP-s show an enhancement in both s- and r-process elements (CEMP-s/r). In order to explain the peculiar abundances observed in CEMP-s/r, we assume that the molecular cloud from which CEMP-s formed was previously enriched in r-elements by supernova pollution.A general discussion and the method adopted in order to interpret the observations have been provided in Bisterzo et al. (Paper II of this series). We present in this paper a detailed study of spectroscopic observations of individual stars. We consider all elements from carbon to bismuth, with particular attention to the three s-process peaks, ls (Y, Zr), hs (La, Nd, Sm) and Pb, and their ratios [hs/ls] and [Pb/hs]. The presence of an initial r-process contribution may be typically evaluated by [La/Eu]. We found possible agreements between theoretical predictions and spectroscopic data. In general, the observed [Na/Fe] (and [Mg/Fe]) provides information on the AGB initial mass, while [hs/ls] and [Pb/hs] are mainly indicators of the s-process efficiency. A range of 13C-pocket strengths are required to interpret the observations. However, major discrepancies between models and observations exist. We highlight star by star the agreements and the main problems encountered and, when possible, we suggest potential indications for further studies. These discrepancies provide starting points of debate for unsolved problems in which spectroscopic and theoretical studies may intervene.},

These are the red-giant tip, the start of the thermally pulsing AGB phase, and core C-ignition according to the initial mass of the stars. The models span the range of initial mass 1.2 to 9 solar mass and have metal contents Z = 0.001 and Z = 0.020, assuming X = 0.700. The major novelty with respect to other computations (Becker, 1981; VandenBerg, 1985) is the inclusion of convective overshooting during core H and He burning phases, according to the prescription given by Bressan et al. (1981). Among others, one of the most important results of these computations is that the critical initial masses, below which core He-flash and C-ignition in highly degenerate material occur are now significantly lower than in classic models. The information contained in the tables can be applied to a large variety of astrophysical problems. In particular, it can be used in the study of the HR diagrams of young and intermediate-age star clusters.},

These super-asymptotic giant branch (super-AGB) and massive AGB star models are in the mass range between 5.0 and 10.0 M⊙ for metallicities spanning the range Z = 0.02-0.0001. We probe the mass limits Mup, Mn and Mmass, the minimum masses for the onset of carbon burning, the formation of a neutron star and the iron core-collapse supernovae, respectively, to constrain the white dwarf/electron-capture supernova (EC-SN) boundary. We provide a theoretical initial-to-final mass relation for the massive and ultra-massive white dwarfs and specify the mass range for the occurrence of hybrid CO(Ne) white dwarfs. We predict EC-SN rates for lower metallicities which are significantly lower than existing values from parametric studies in the literature. We conclude that the EC-SN channel (for single stars and with the critical assumption being the choice of mass-loss rate) is very narrow in initial mass, at most $\approx$0.2 M⊙. This implies that between {\~{ }}2 and 5 per cent of all gravitational collapse supernova are EC-SNe in the metallicity range Z = 0.02-0.0001. With our choice for mass-loss prescription and computed core growth rates, we find, within our metallicity range, that CO cores cannot grow sufficiently massive to undergo a Type 1.5 SN explosion.},

abstract = {The chemically most primitive stars provide constraints on the nature of the first stellar objects that formed in the Universe; elements other than hydrogen, helium and traces of lithium present within these objects were generated by nucleosynthesis in the very first stars. The relative abundances of elements in the surviving primitive stars reflect the masses of the first stars, because the pathways of nucleosynthesis are quite sensitive to stellar masses. Several models have been suggested to explain the origin of the abundance pattern of the giant star HE0107-5240, which hitherto exhibited the highest deficiency of heavy elements known. Here we report the discovery of HE1327-2326, a subgiant or main-sequence star with an iron abundance about a factor of two lower than that of HE0107-5240. Both stars show extreme overabundances of carbon and nitrogen with respect to iron, suggesting a similar origin of the abundance patterns. The unexpectedly low Li and high Sr abundances of HE1327-2326, however, challenge existing theoretical understanding: no model predicts the high Sr abundance or provides a Li depletion mechanism consistent with data available for the most metal-poor stars.},

This study increases the number of S stars in $\omega$ Cen for which high-quality abundance analyses exist to eight. The abundance of post-iron-peak elements supports the hypothesis that the spread in metallicities and heavy-element abundances observed among stars in the cluster is due to chemical self-enrichment of $\omega$ Cen by supernovae and low-mass asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. Furthermore, the post-iron-peak elements suggest that the self-enrichment of the cluster was complex and nonhomogeneous with respect to the s-process elements.},

abstract = {Context. Thanks to the heroic observational campaigns carried out in recent years we now have large samples of metal-poor stars for which measurements of detailed abundances exist. In particular, large samples of stars with metallicities -5 < [Fe/H] <-1 and measured abundances of Sr, Ba, Y, and Eu are now available. These data hold important clues on the nature of the contribution of the first stellar generations to the enrichment of our Galaxy. Aims: We aim to explain the scatter in Sr, Ba, Y, and Eu abundance ratio diagrams unveiled by the metal-poor halo stars. Methods: We computed inhomogeneous chemical evolution models for the Galactic halo assuming different scenarios for the r-process site: the electron-capture (EC) supernovae and the magnetorotationally driven (MRD) supernovae scenarios. We also considered models with and without the contribution of fast-rotating massive stars (spinstars) to an early enrichment by the s-process. A detailed comparison with the now large sample of stars with measured abundances of Sr, Ba, Y, Eu, and Fe is provided (both in terms of scatter plots and number distributions for several abundance ratios). Results: The scatter observed in these abundance ratios of the very metal-poor stars (with [Fe/H] <-2.5) can be explained by combining the s-process production in spinstars, and the r-process contribution coming from massive stars. For the r-process we have developed models for both the EC and the MRD scenarios that match the observations. Conclusions: With the present observational and theoretical constraints we cannot distinguish between the EC and the MRD scenarios in the Galactic halo. Independently of the r-process scenarios adopted, the production of elements by an s-process in spinstars is needed to reproduce the spread in abundances of the light neutron capture elements (Sr and Y) over heavy neutron capture elements (Ba and Eu). We provide a way to test our suggestions by means of the distribution of the Ba isotopic ratios in a [Ba/Fe] or [Sr/Ba] vs. [Fe/H] diagram.

abstract = {We have studied the dissolution of initially mass-segregated and unsegregated star clusters due to two-body relaxation in external tidal fields, using Aarseth's collisional N-body code NBODY4 on GRAPE6 special-purpose computers. When extrapolating results of initially non-mass-segregated models to globular clusters, we obtain a correlation between the time until destruction and the slope of the mass function, in the sense that globular clusters that are closer to dissolution are more strongly depleted in low-mass stars. This correlation fits observed mass functions of most globular clusters. The mass functions of several globular clusters are, however, more strongly depleted in low-mass stars than is suggested by these models. Such strongly depleted mass functions can be explained if globular clusters started initially mass segregated. Primordial mass segregation also explains the correlation between the slope of the stellar mass function and the cluster concentration that was recently discovered by De Marchi and coworkers. In this case, it is possible that all globular clusters started with a mass function similar to that seen in young open clusters in the present-day universe, at least for stars below m=0.8 Msolar. This argues for a near universality of the mass function for different star formation environments and metallicities in the range -2<[Fe/H]<0. We finally describe a novel algorithm that can initialize stationary mass-segregated clusters with an arbitrary density profile and amount of mass segregation.},

In addition, it was found that the amounts of helium and hydrogen burned remained approximately constant around the maximum of each flash cycle, but around the minimum of the cycle, the mass of hydrogen remained constant, while that of helium became smaller as the flash strength increased.},

abstract = {We use detailed nucleosynthesis calculations and a realistic prescription for the environment of the first stars to explore the first episodes of chemical enrichment that occurred during the dark ages. Based on these calculations, we propose a novel explanation for the increased prevalence of carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars with decreasing Fe abundance: the observed chemistry for the most metal-poor Galactic halo stars is the result of an intimate link between the explosions of the first stars and their host minihalo's ability to retain its gas. Specifically, high-energy supernovae produce a near solar ratio of C/Fe, but are effective in evacuating the gas from their host minihalo, thereby suppressing the formation of a second generation of stars. On the other hand, minihalos that host low-energy supernovae are able to retain their gas and form a second stellar generation, but, as a result, the second stars are born with a supersolar ratio of C/Fe. Our models are able to accurately reproduce the observed distributions of [C/Fe] and [Fe/H], as well as the fraction of CEMP stars relative to non-CEMP stars as a function of [Fe/H] without any free parameters. We propose that the present lack of chemical evidence for very massive stars (gsim 140 M {\&}{\#}9737;) that ended their lives as a highly energetic pair-instability supernova does not imply that such stars were rare or did not exist; the chemical products of these very massive first stars may have been evacuated from their host minihalos and were never incorporated into subsequent generations of stars. Finally, our models suggest that the most Fe-poor stars currently known may have seen the enrichment from a small multiple of metal-free stars, and need not have been exclusively enriched by a solitary first star. These calculations also add further support to the possibility that some of the surviving dwarf satellite galaxies of the Milky Way are the relics of the first galaxies.},

The chemical evolution calculation employs a simple dynamical model for the Galaxy (infall with a 4 Gyr e-folding timescale onto a exponential disk and 1/r2 bulge), and standard evolution parameters, such as a Salpeter initial mass function and a quadratic Schmidt star formation rate. The theoretical results are compared in detail with observed stellar abundances in stars with metallicities in the range -3.0 approx. less than (Fe/H) approx. less than 0.0 dex. While our discussion focuses on the solar neighborhood where there are the most observations, the supernova rates, an intrinsically Galactic quality, are also discussed.},

Spectral analyses were carried out on the basis of the strengths of the (0, 0) MgH band and the Mg b triplet. In our sample, four giants were identified with weak/absent MgH bands in their observed spectra, which was unexpected for their well determined stellar parameters. The Mg abundances for the program stars were determined from the subordinate lines of the MgH band to the blue of the Mg b triplet, using the spectral synthesis technique. The derived Mg abundances for the program stars were as expected for the red giants of $\omega$ Cen, except for the four identified candidates. The determined Mg abundances of these four candidates are much lower than that expected for the red giants of $\omega$ Cen, and are unacceptable based on the strengths of the Mg b triplet in their observed spectra. Hence, a plausible explanation for the weak/absent MgH bands in the observed spectra of these stars is a relatively lower abundance of hydrogen in their atmospheres. These giants may belong to the group of helium-enriched red giants of $\omega$ Cen.},

abstract = {Context. Multiple populations have been detected in several globular clusters (GC) that do not display a spread in metallicity. Unusual features of their observed colour-magnitude diagrams (CMD) can be interpreted in terms of differences in the helium content of the stars belonging to the sub-populations. Aims: Even if evidence gathered so far is compelling, differences in He abundance have never been directly observed. We attempt to measure these differences in two giant stars of NGC 2808 with very similar astrophysical parameters but different Na and O abundances, hence that presumably belong to different sub-populations, by directly comparing their He I 10 830 {\AA} lines. Methods: The He 10 830 {\AA} line forms in the upper chromosphere. Our detailed models derive the chromospheric structure using the Ca II and H$\alpha$ chromospheric lines, and simulate the corresponding He I 10 830 line profiles as a function of the helium abundance. We show that, at a given value of He abundance, the He I 10 830 equivalent width cannot significantly change without a corresponding much larger change in the Ca II chromospheric lines. We have used the VLT-CRIRES to obtain high-resolution spectra in the 10 830 {\AA} region, and the VLT-UVES to obtain spectra of the Ca II and H$\alpha$ lines of our target stars. Results: The two target stars have very similar Ca II and H$\alpha$ chromospheric lines, but different appearances in the He region. One line, blueshifted by 17 km s-1 with respect to the He 10 830 rest wavelength, is detected in the spectrum of the Na-rich star, whereas the Na-poor star spectrum is consistent with a non-detection. From a detailed chromospheric modeling, we show that the difference in the spectra is consistent and most closely explained by an He abundance difference between the two stars of $\Delta$Y $\ge$ 0.17. Our optical observations bracket the infrared ones over a range of about 50 days and we do not observe any substantial variability in the Ca II and H$\alpha$ lines. Conclusions: We provide direct evidence of a significant He line strength difference in giant stars of NGC 2808 belonging to different sub-populations, which had been previously detected by other photometric and spectroscopic means. The use of appropriate model chromospheres allows us for the first time to provide an approximate quantitative estimate of this difference, which is clearly consistent with the expected difference in abundance required by the stellar evolution theory to account for the observed peculiarities of this cluster's cmD.

abstract = {The study fits the elemental abundances observed in MS and S giants using self-consistent models of nucleosynthesis and dredge-up for the TP-AGB evolutionary phases of low-mass stars. The initial envelope abundances of C-12, C-13, and N-14 are taken from observations of red giants that experienced the first dredge-up and are not yet on the AGB. It is found that the observed abundances of MS and S stars are readily explained by TP-AGB models of low-mass stars in which neutrons are released by the C-13(alpha, n)O-16 neutron source and in which the effects of mass loss and mixing due to envelope penetration are taken into account. The observed distributions of s-elements alone do not suffice to derive the neutron exposure in the He-shell, because the observed distributions are strongly affected also by how and when the third dredge-up occurs. The relative roles of mixing and of nucleosynthesis may be estimated by requiring the models to reproduce the abundances of C as well as of the s-elements. It is shown that single Tc-poor S star may exist, if the dredge-up phenomenon occurs rarely enough to allow Tc to decay between successive mixing episodes.},

abstract = {Tests of big bang nucleosynthesis and early universe cosmology require precision measurements for helium abundance determinations. However, efforts to determine the primordial helium abundance via observations of metal poor H II regions have been limited by significant uncertainties (compared with the value inferred from BBN theory using the CMB determined value of the baryon density). This work builds upon previous work by providing an updated and extended program in evaluating these uncertainties. Procedural consistency is achieved by integrating the hydrogen based reddening correction with the helium based abundance calculation, i.e., all physical parameters are solved for simultaneously. We include new atomic data for helium recombination and collisional emission based upon recent work by Porter \etal and wavelength dependent corrections to underlying absorption are investigated. The set of physical parameters has been expanded here to include the effects of neutral hydrogen collisional emission. It is noted that H$\gamma$ and H$\delta$ allow better isolation of the collisional effects from the reddening. Because of a degeneracy between the solutions for density and temperature, the precision of the helium abundance determinations is limited. Also, at lower temperatures (T lesssim 13,000 K) the neutral hydrogen fraction is poorly constrained resulting in a larger uncertainty in the helium abundances. Thus, the derived errors on the helium abundances for individual objects are larger than those typical of previous studies. Seven previously analyzed, ``high quality'' H II region spectra are used for a primordial helium abundance determination. The updated emissivities and neutral hydrogen correction generally raise the abundance. From a regression to zero metallicity, we find Yp as 0.2561 {\textpm} 0.0108, in broad agreement with the WMAP result. Alternatively, a simple average of the data yields Yp 0.2566 {\textpm} 0.0028. Tests with synthetic data show a potential for distinct improvement, via removal of underlying absorption, using higher resolution spectra. A small bias in the abundance determination can be reduced significantly and the calculated helium abundance error can be reduced by {\textasciitilde} 25%.},

In this work we concentrate on three types of hot stars observed in globular clusters: horizontal branch stars, UV-bright stars, and white dwarfs. After providing some historical background and information on gaps and blue tails, we discuss extensively hot horizontal branch stars in metal-poor globular clusters, especially their abundance anomalies and the consequences for the determination of their atmospheric parameters and evolutionary status. Hot horizontal branch stars in metal-rich globular clusters are found to form a small but rather inhomogeneous group that cannot be explained by one evolutionary scenario. Hot UV-bright stars show a lack of classic post-asymptotic giant branch stars that may explain the lack of planetary nebulae in globular clusters. Finally, we discuss first results of spectroscopic observations of white dwarfs in globular clusters.},

abstract = {Intermediate resolution spectra at the Ca II triplet have been obtained for 55 candidate red giants in the field of the globular cluster M22 with the VLT/FORS2 instrument. Spectra were also obtained for a number of red giants in standard globular clusters to provide a calibration of the observed line strengths with overall abundance [Fe/H]. For the 41 M22 member stars that lie within the V - VHB bounds of the calibration, we find an abundance distribution that is substantially broader than that expected from the observed errors alone. We argue that this broad distribution cannot be the result of differential reddening. Instead, we conclude that, as has long been suspected, M22 is similar to $\omega$ Cen in having an intrinsic dispersion in heavy element abundance. The observed M22 abundance distribution rises sharply to a peak at [Fe/H] $\approx$-1.9 with a broad tail to higher abundances: the highest abundance star in our sample has [Fe/H] $\approx$-1.45 dex. If the unusual properties of $\omega$ Cen have their origin in a scenario in which the cluster is the remnant nucleus of a disrupted dwarf galaxy, then such a scenario likely also applies to M22.

abstract = {Recent observations of heavy elements in globular clusters reveal intriguing deviations from the standard paradigm of the early galactic nucleosynthesis. If the r-process contamination is a common feature of halo stars, s-process enhancements are found in a few globular clusters only. We show that the combined pollution of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars with a mass ranging between 3 to 6 M {\&}{\#}9737; may account for most of the features of the s-process overabundance in M4 and M22. In these stars, the s process is a mixture of two very different neutron-capture nucleosynthesis episodes. The first is due to the 13C($\alpha$, n)16O reaction and takes place during the interpulse periods. The second is due to the 22Ne($\alpha$, n)25Mg reaction and takes place in the convective zones generated by thermal pulses. The production of the heaviest s elements (from Ba to Pb) requires the first neutron burst, while the second produces large overabundances of light s (Rb, Sr, Y, Zr). The first mainly operates in the less massive AGB stars, while the second dominates in the more massive. From the heavy-s/light-s ratio, we derive that the pollution phase should last for 150 {\textpm} 50 Myr, a period short enough compared to the formation timescale of the globular cluster system, but long enough to explain why the s-process pollution is observed in a few cases only. With few exceptions, our theoretical prediction provides a reasonable reproduction of the observed s-process abundances, from Sr to Hf. However, Ce is probably underproduced by our models, while Rb and Pb are overproduced. Possible solutions are discussed.},

abstract = {We present a review of nucleosynthesis in AGB stars outlining the development of theoretical models and their relationship to observations. We focus on the new high resolution codes with improved opacities, which recently succeeded in accounting for the third dredge-up. This opens the possibility of understanding low luminosity C stars (enriched in s-elements) as the normal outcome of AGB evolution, characterized by production of 12C and neutron-rich nuclei in the He intershell and by mass loss from strong stellar winds. Neutron captures in AGB stars are driven by two reactions: 13C([$\alpha$],n)16O, which provides the bulk of the neutron flux at low neutron densities (Nn [<=] 107 n/cm3), and 22Ne([$\alpha$],n)25Mg, which is mildly activated at higher temperatures and mainly affects the production of s-nuclei depending on reaction branchings. The first reaction is now known to occur in the radiative interpulse phase, immediately below the region previously homogenized by third dredge-up. The second reaction occurs during the convective thermal pulses. The resulting nucleosynthesis phenomena are rather complex and rule out any analytical approximation (exponential distribution of neutron fluences). Nucleosynthesis in AGB stars, modeled at different metallicities, account for several observational constraints, coming from a wide spectrum of sources: evolved red giants rich in s-elements, unevolved stars at different metallicities, presolar grains recovered from meteorites, and the abundances of s-process isotopes in the solar system. In particular, a good reproduction of the solar system main component is obtained as a result of Galactic chemical evolution that mixes the outputs of AGB stars of different stellar generations, born with different metallicities and producing different patterns of s-process nuclei. The main solar s-process pattern is thus not considered to be the result of a standard archetypal s-process occurring in all stars. Concerning the 13C neutron source, its synthesis requires penetration of small amounts of protons below the convective envelope, where they are captured by the abundant 12C forming a 13C-rich pocket. This penetration cannot be modeled in current evolutionary codes, but is treated as a free parameter. Future hydrodynamical studies of time dependent mixing will be required to attack this problem. Evidence of other insufficiencies in the current mixing algorithms is common throughout the evolution of low and intermediate mass stars, as is shown by the inadequacy of stellar models in reproducing the observations of CNO isotopes in red giants and in circumstellar dust grains. These observations require some circulation of matter between the bottom of convective envelopes and regions close to the H-burning shell (cool bottom processing). AGB stars are also discussed in the light of their possible contribution to the inventory of short-lived radioactivities that were found to be alive in the early solar system. We show that the pollution of the protosolar nebula by a close-by AGB star may account for concordant abundances of 26Al, 41Ca, 60Fe, and 107Pd. The AGB star must have undergone a very small neutron exposure, and be of small initial mass ([Image]). There is a shortage of 26Al in such models, that however remains within the large uncertainties of crucial reaction rates. The net 26Al production problem requires further investigation.},

abstract = {We present a chemical abundance analysis based on high resolution UVES spectra of seventeen bright giant stars in the Globular Cluster (GC) M 22. We obtained an average iron abundance of [Fe/H] = -1.76{\textpm}0.02 (internal errors only) and an $\alpha$ enhancement of 0.36{\textpm}0.04 (internal errors only). Na and O, and Al and O follow the well known anticorrelations found in many other GCs. We identified two groups of stars with significantly different abundances of the s-process elements Y, Zr, and Ba. The relative numbers of the two group members are very similar to the ratio of the number of stars in the two sub giant branches (SGB) of M 22. Y and Ba abundances do not correlate with Na, O, and Al. The s-element rich stars are also richer in iron and have higher Ca abundances. The results from high resolution spectra were confirmed by analyses of lower resolution GIRAFFE spectra of fourteen additional M 22 stars. The analyses of the GIRAFFE spectra also show that the Eu - a pure r-process element - abundance is not related to the iron content. We discuss the chemical abundance pattern of M 22 stars in the context of GC multiple stellar populations phenomenon.

abstract = {The abundance of the neutron-rich magnesium isotopes observed in metal-poor stars is explained quantitatively with a chemical evolution model of the local Galaxy that considers - for the first time - the metallicity-dependent contribution from intermediate mass stars. Previous models that simulate the variation of Mg isotopic ratios with metallicity in the solar neighbourhood have attributed the production of 25Mg and 26Mg exclusively to hydrostatic burning in massive stars. These models match the data well for [Fe/H] > -1.0 but severely underestimate 25,26Mg/24Mg at lower metallicities. Earlier studies have noted that this discrepancy may indicate a significant role played by intermediate mass stars. Only recently have detailed calculations of intermediate mass stellar yields of 25Mg and 26Mg become available with which to test this hypothesis. In an extension of previous work, we present a model that successfully matches the Mg isotopic abundances in nearby Galactic disk stars through the incorporation of nucleosynthesis predictions of Mg isotopic production in asymptotic giant branch stars.},

We analyzed a sample of high-resolution spectra (secured with FLAMES at the Very Large Telescope) for eight giant stars, members of the cluster, finding an average iron content of [Fe/H] = -0.60 {\textpm} 0.01 dex and no evidence of intrinsic star-to-star variations in the abundances of light elements (Na, O, Mg, Al). Also, the (m F814W ; m F336W - m F814W ) color-magnitude diagram obtained by combining optical and near-UV Hubble Space Telescope photometry exhibits a narrow red giant branch, thus ruling out intrinsic variations of C and N abundances in the cluster. These findings demonstrate that NGC 1806 does not harbor chemically distinct sub-populations, at variance with what was found in old globular clusters. In turn, this indicates that the double main sequence turnoff phenomenon cannot be explained in the context of the self-enrichment processes usually invoked to explain the chemical anomalies observed in old globulars. Other solutions (i.e., stellar rotation, merging between clusters, or collisions with giant molecular clouds) should be envisaged to explain this class of globulars.

abstract = {We use cosmological simulations to study the origin of primordial star-forming clouds in a $\Lambda$CDM universe, by following the formation of dark matter halos and the cooling of gas within them. To model the physics of chemically pristine gas, we employ a nonequilibrium treatment of the chemistry of nine species (e-, H, H+, He, He+, He++, H2, H+2, H-) and include cooling by molecular hydrogen. By considering cosmological volumes, we are able to study the statistical properties of primordial halos, and the high resolution of our simulations enables us to examine these objects in detail. In particular, we explore the hierarchical growth of bound structures forming at redshifts z{\textasciitilde}25-30 with total masses in the range {\textasciitilde}105-106Msolar. We find that when the amount of molecular hydrogen in these objects reaches a critical level, cooling by rotational line emission is efficient, and dense clumps of cold gas form. We identify these ``gas clouds'' as sites for primordial star formation. In our simulations, the threshold for gas cloud formation by molecular cooling corresponds to a critical halo mass of {\textasciitilde}5{\texttimes}105h-1Msolar, in agreement with earlier estimates, but with a weak dependence on redshift in the range z>16. The complex interplay between the gravitational formation of dark halos and the thermodynamic and chemical evolution of the gas clouds compromises analytic estimates of the critical H2 fraction. Dynamical heating from mass accretion and mergers opposes relatively inefficient cooling by molecular hydrogen, delaying the production of star-forming clouds in rapidly growing halos. We also investigate the effect of photodissociating ultraviolet radiation on the formation of primordial gas clouds. We consider two extreme cases, first by including a uniform radiation field in the optically thin limit and second by accounting for the maximum effect of gas self-shielding in virialized regions. For radiation with Lyman-Werner band flux J>10-23 ergs s-1 cm-2 Hz-1 sr-1, hydrogen molecules are rapidly dissociated, rendering gas cooling inefficient. In both the cases we consider, the overall effect can be described by computing an equilibrium H2 abundance for the radiation flux and defining an effective shielding factor. Based on our numerical results, we develop a semianalytic model of the formation of the first stars and demonstrate how it can be coupled with large N-body simulations to predict the star formation rate in the early universe.},

We report the discovery of strong Rb I lines at 7800 {\AA} in four Rb-rich LMC stars at luminosities equal to or greater than the standard adopted luminosity limit for AGB stars (M bol {\textasciitilde} -7.1), confirming that "hot bottom burning" may produce a flux excess in the more massive AGB stars. In the SMC sample, just one of the five stars with M bol < -7.1 was detected in Rb; the other stars may be massive red supergiants. The Rb-rich LMC AGB stars might have stellar masses of at least {\textasciitilde}6-7 M sun. Our abundance analyses show that these Rb-rich stars are extremely enriched in Rb by up to 103-105 times solar but seem to have only mild Zr enhancements. The high Rb/Zr ratios, if real, represent a severe problem for the s-process, even if the 22Ne source is operational as expected for massive AGB stars; it is not possible to synthesize copious amounts of Rb without also overproducing Zr. The solution to the problem may lie with an incomplete present understanding of the atmospheres of luminous AGB stars.},

abstract = {Based on two-dimensional numerical radiation hydrodynamics simulations of time-dependent compressible convection, we have studied the structure and dynamics of a variety of shallow stellar surface convection zones. Our present grid of models includes detailed simulations of surface convection in solar-type stars, main-sequence A-type stars and cool DA white dwarfs, as well as numerical experiments to study convection and overshoot at the base of the solar convection zone. Taking into account a realistic equation of state (including the effects of ionization) and adopting an elaborate treatment of non-local radiative transfer (with appropriate grey or frequency-dependent opacities), our simulations are designed to represent specific stellar objects characterized by T_eff_, logg, and chemical composition. Contrary to solar-type stars, the A-type stars and cool DA white dwarfs investigated here have shallow convection zones which fit into the computational domain together with thick stable buffer layers on top and below, thus permitting a study of convective overshoot under genuine conditions. We find that convective motions extend well beyond the boundary of the convectively unstable region, with vertical velocities decaying exponentially with depth in the deeper parts of the lower overshoot region, as expected for linear g^-^-modes. Even though convective velocities are reduced by orders of magnitude, they are still able to counteract molecular diffusion. For a quantitative description of convective mixing in the far overshoot layers we have derived a depth dependent diffusion coefficient from the numerical simulations. In combination with otherwise independent 1D diffusion calculations for a trace element, this allows the determination of the "effective depth" of the overshoot region. For a typical main-sequence A-type star (T_eff_=7943{\#}1, logg=4.34) the mass in the overshoot region exceeds the mass in the unstable region by approximately a factor 10. The amount of overshoot in cool DA white dwarfs (around T_eff_=12200{\#}1) is even larger: the convectively mixed mass is increased by roughly a factor 100.},

abstract = {The presence of multiple populations in globular clusters has been well established thanks to high-resolution spectroscopy. It is widely accepted that distinct populations are a consequence of different stellar generations: intracluster pollution episodes are required to produce the peculiar chemistry observed in almost all clusters. Unfortunately, the progenitors responsible have left an ambiguous signature and their nature remains unresolved. To constrain the candidate polluters, we have measured lithium and aluminium abundances in more than 180 giants across three systems: NGC 1904, NGC 2808, and NGC 362. The present investigation along with our previous analysis of M12 and M5 affords us the largest data base of simultaneous determinations of Li and Al abundances. Our results indicate that Li production has occurred in each of the three clusters. In NGC 362, we detected an M12-like behaviour, with first- and second-generation stars sharing very similar Li abundances favouring a progenitor that is able to produce Li, such as asymptotic giant branches stars. Multiple progenitor types are possible in NGC 1904 and NGC 2808, as they possess both an intermediate population comparable in lithium to the first generation stars and also an extreme population, that is enriched in Al but depleted in Li. A simple dilution model fails in reproducing this complex pattern. Finally, the internal Li variation seems to suggest that the production efficiency of this element is a function of the cluster's mass and metallicity - low-mass or relatively metal-rich clusters are more adept at producing Li.},

abstract = {Galactic chemical evolution models require stellar nucleosynthesis yields as input data. Stellar evolution models are used to calculate such yields but do not take into account the fact that many stars are in binaries. The computing time required to explore the binary star parameter space is usually considered to be prohibitively large. Therefore binaries, except for type Ia supernovae and novae which are included in an ad hoc way, are ignored in most Galactic chemical evolution models. In this dissertation synthetic nucleosynthesis models are developed which approximate full stellar evolution models. Cunning methods are employed to model shell burning in low- and intermediate-mass stars while high-mass stars have their surface abundances fitted to their mass. Explosive yields are fitted to published results. The synthetic nucleosynthesis model, with the addition of algorithms to deal with mass transfer in binaries, is coupled to a rapid binary star evolution code. The use of a synthetic model speeds up the calculation of stellar yields by a factor of about 107 and extends the analysis to binary stars. Single- and binary-star yields are calculated for a range of initial mass and separation distributions. A change in the primary or single-star mass distribution is most significant. Changing the secondary mass or separation distribution has a smaller effect. Consideration is then given to variation of the input physics to determine which free parameters are important for the calculation of yields from single and binary stars. It is found that certain parameters are important for some isotopes. Future prospects are then briefly discussed.},

abstract = {Several grids of post-horizontal-branch evolutionary models have been constructed assuming a range in either total mass or initial core mass on the horizontal branch. The less luminous Population II Cepheids (BL Herculis stars) are identified with stars of small envelope mass undergoing 'blueward noses' from the asymptotic giant branch due to readjustments between the hydrogen- and helium-burning shell luminosities following the exhaustion of helium in the core. The more luminous Cepheids (W Virginis stars) are identified with stars undergoing blueward loops from the second giant branch in response to helium shell flashes or finally evolving to the blue as the hydrogen-burning shell nears the stellar surface. The models predict relatively too few variables spread over too large a range in luminosity in the brighter group. Mass loss on the second giant branch is suggested to help resolve this problem. The assumption of a range in total mass on the zero-age horizontal branch produces a slightly better fit to the observed luminosity distribution of Population II Cepheids than does the assumption of a range in initial core mass.},

abstract = {It is well appreciated that the description of overadiabatic convection affects the structure of the envelopes of luminous asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars in the phase of ``hot bottom burning'' (HBB). We stress that this important uncertainty in the modeling plays a role which is much more dramatic than the role which can be ascribed, e.g., to the uncertainty in the nuclear cross-sections. Due to the role tentatively attributed today to the HBB nucleosynthesis as the site of self-enrichment of Globular Clusters stars, it is necessary to explore the difference in nucleosynthesis obtained by different prescriptions for convection. We present results of detailed evolutionary calculations of the evolution of stars of intermediate mass during the AGB phase for the metallicity typical of the Globular Clusters that show the largest spread in CNO abundances (Z{\~{ }} 10-3). We follow carefully the nucleosynthesis at the base of the external convective region, showing that very different results can be obtained according to the presciption adopted to find out the temperature gradient within the instability regions. We discuss the uncertainties in the yields of the various chemical species and the role which these sources can play as polluters of the interstellar medium.},

Such episodes of secondary (or continuous) star formation are predicted by models that attempt to explain the observed chemical and photometric anomalies observed in globular clusters as being due to the formation of a second stellar population within an existing first population. Additionally, studies that have claimed extended star formation histories within Large/Small Magellanic Cloud intermediate-age clusters (1-2 Gyr), also imply that many YMCs should show ongoing star formation. Based on visual inspection of the spectra and/or the colour-magnitude diagrams, we do not find evidence for ongoing star formation within any of the clusters, and use this to place constraints on the above models. Models of continuous star formation within clusters, lasting for hundreds of Myr, are ruled out at high significance (unless stellar initial mass function variations are invoked). Models for the (nearly instantaneous) formation of a secondary population within an existing first generation are not favoured, but are not formally discounted due to the finite sampling of age/mass-space.},

abstract = {We performed three-dimensional simulations of proton-rich material entrainment into 12C-rich He-shell flash convection and the subsequent H-ingestion flash that took place in the post-asymptotic giant branch star Sakurai's object. Observations of the transient nature and anomalous abundance features are available to validate our method and assumptions, with the aim of applying them to very low-metallicity stars in the future. We include nuclear energy feedback from H burning and cover the full 4$\pi$ geometry of the shell. Runs on 7683 and 15363 grids agree well with each other and have been followed for 1500 minutes and 1200 minutes. After an 850 minute long quiescent entrainment phase, the simulations enter into a global non-spherical oscillation that is launched and sustained by individual ignition events of H-rich fluid pockets. Fast circumferential flows collide at the antipode and cause the formation and localized ignition of the next H-overabundant pocket. The cycle repeats for more than a dozen times while its amplitude decreases. During the global oscillation, the entrainment rate increases temporarily by a factor of $\approx$100. Entrained entropy quenches convective motions in the upper layer until the burning of entrained H establishes a separate convection zone. The lower-resolution run hints at the possibility that another global oscillation, perhaps even more violent, will follow. The location of the H-burning convection zone agrees with a one-dimensional model in which the mixing efficiency is calibrated to reproduce the light curve. The simulations have been performed at the NSF Blue Waters supercomputer at NCSA.},

Stringent pre-discovery limits constrain the explosion epoch with fair precision to JD = 245 6203.8 {\textpm} 4.0. The rise time to the I-band light-curve maximum is about two weeks. The object reaches the peak absolute magnitude MI = -19.65 {\textpm} 0.19 on JD = 245 6218.1 {\textpm} 1.8. After maximum, the light curve declines for about 25 d with a rate of 4 mag (100 d)-1. The symmetric I-band peak resembles that of canonical Type Ib/c supernovae (SNe), whereas SNe Ibn usually exhibit asymmetric and narrower early-time light curves. Since 25 d past maximum, the light curve flattens with a decline rate slower than that of the 56Co-56Fe decay, although at very late phases it steepens to approach that rate. However, other observables suggest that the match with the 56Co decay rate is a mere coincidence, and the radioactive decay is not the main mechanism powering the light curve of OGLE-2012-SN-006. An early-time spectrum is dominated by a blue continuum, with only a marginal evidence for the presence of He I lines marking this SN type. This spectrum shows broad absorptions bluewards than 5000 {\AA}, likely O II lines, which are similar to spectral features observed in superluminous SNe at early epochs. The object has been spectroscopically monitored by PESSTO from 90 to 180 d after peak, and these spectra show the typical features observed in a number of SN 2006jc-like events, including a blue spectral energy distribution and prominent and narrow (vFWHM $\approx$ 1900 km s-1) He I emission lines. This suggests that the ejecta are interacting with He-rich circumstellar material. The detection of broad (104 km s-1) O I and Ca II features likely produced in the SN ejecta (including the [O I] $\lambda$$\lambda$6300,6364 doublet in the latest spectra) lends support to the interpretation of OGLE-2012-SN-006 as a core-collapse event.},

abstract = {The reaction rates of the s-process neutron producing 22Ne($\alpha$,n)25Mg reaction and its competing 22Ne($\alpha$, $\gamma$)26Mg reaction are needed to accurately predict nucleosynthesis in massive stars and Asymptotic Giant Branch stars. Here, we present a re-evaluation of the reaction rates by incorporating recent data and by using a Monte Carlo uncertainty propagation method. The effect of those results on nucleosynthesis in massive stars is studied. We show that our new rates lead to similar final abundances, but with significantly reduced uncertainties in comparison to literature rates.},

abstract = {In this Letter we present an optical spectrum of SN 2011fe taken 1034 d after the explosion, several hundred days later than any other spectrum of a Type Ia supernova (disregarding light-echo spectra and Local Group remnants). The spectrum is still dominated by broad emission features, with no trace of a light echo or interaction of the supernova ejecta with surrounding interstellar material. Comparing this extremely late spectrum to an earlier one taken 331 d after the explosion, we find that the most prominent feature at 331 d - [Fe III] emission around 4700 {\AA} - has entirely faded away, suggesting a significant change in the ionization state. Instead, [Fe II] lines are probably responsible for most of the emission at 1034 d. An emission feature at 6300-6400 {\AA} has newly developed at 1034 d, which we tentatively identify with Fe I $\lambda$6359, [Fe I] $\lambda$$\lambda$6231, 6394 or [O I] $\lambda$$\lambda$6300, 6364. Interestingly, the features in the 1034 d spectrum seem to be collectively redshifted, a phenomenon that we currently have no convincing explanation for. We discuss the implications of our findings for explosion models, but conclude that sophisticated spectral modelling is required for any firm statement.},

abstract = {The various scenarios proposed for the origin of the multiple, helium-enriched populations in massive globular clusters are critically compared to the relevant constraining observations. Among accretion of helium-rich material by pre-existing stars, star formation out of ejecta from massive asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars or from fast rotating massive stars, and pollution by Population III stars, only the AGB option appears to be viable. Accretion or star formation out of outflowing discs would result in a spread of helium abundances, thus failing to produce the distinct, chemically homogeneous subpopulations such as those in the clusters $\omega$ Cen and NGC 2808. Pollution by Population III stars would fail to produce subpopulations selectively enriched in helium, but maintaining the same abundance of heavy elements. Still, it is argued that for the AGB option to work, two conditions should be satisfied: (i) AGB stars experiencing the hot bottom burning process (i.e. those more massive than {\textasciitilde}3Msolar) should rapidly eject their envelope upon arrival on the AGB, thus experiencing just a few third dredge-up episodes; and (ii) clusters with multiple, helium-enriched populations should be the remnants of much more massive systems, such as nucleated dwarf galaxies, as indeed widely assumed.},

abstract = {Nucleosynthesis in the s process takes place in the He-burning layers of low-mass asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars and during the He- and C-burning phases of massive stars. The s process contributes about half of the element abundances between Cu and Bi in solar system material. Depending on stellar mass and metallicity the resulting s-abundance patterns exhibit characteristic features, which provide comprehensive information for our understanding of the stellar life cycle and for the chemical evolution of galaxies. The rapidly growing body of detailed abundance observations, in particular, for AGB and post-AGB stars, for objects in binary systems, and for the very faint metal-poor population represents exciting challenges and constraints for stellar model calculations. Based on updated and improved nuclear physics data for the s-process reaction network, current models are aiming at an ab initio solution for the stellar physics related to convection and mixing processes. Progress in the intimately related areas of observations, nuclear and atomic physics, and stellar modeling is reviewed and the corresponding interplay is illustrated by the general abundance patterns of the elements beyond iron and by the effect of sensitive branching points along the s-process path. The strong variations of the s-process efficiency with metallicity bear also interesting consequences for galactic chemical evolution.},

The authors define a conservative range for the nucleon-to-photon ratio: $\eta$ = (3 - 10){\texttimes}10-10. New observations of 7Li are consistent with the abundances of D and 3He and help to define a reasonable range: $\eta$ = (4 - 7){\texttimes}10-10. In either of these ranges the predicted and observed abundances of D, 3He, and 7Li are all in concordance. The upper bounds correspond to $\Omega$N $\le$ 0.14 - 0.19, and it is concluded that nucleons fail to close the universe by at least a factor of 5 - 7.

abstract = {We present the results from exploratory Chandra observations of nine high-redshift (z=4.09-4.51) optically selected quasars. These quasars, taken from the Palomar Digital Sky Survey (DPOSS), are among the optically brightest and most luminous z>4 quasars known (MB{\textasciitilde}-28.4 to -30.2). All have been detected by Chandra in exposure times of {\textasciitilde}5-6 ks, tripling the number of highly luminous quasars (MB<-28.4) with X-ray detections at z>4. These quasars' average broadband spectral energy distributions are characterized by steeper (more negative) $\alpha$ox values (<$\alpha$ox>=-1.81+/-0.03) than those of lower luminosity, lower redshift samples of quasars. We confirm the presence of a significant correlation between the ultraviolet magnitude and soft X-ray flux previously found for z>4 quasars. The joint {\textasciitilde}2-30 keV rest-frame X-ray spectrum of the nine quasars is well parameterized by a simple power-law model whose photon index, $\Gamma${\textasciitilde}2.0+/-0.2, is consistent with those of lower redshift quasars. No evidence for significant amounts of intrinsic absorption has been found (NH<{\textasciitilde}8.8{\texttimes}1021 cm-2 at 90% confidence). In general, our results show that z{\textasciitilde}4.1-4.5 quasars and local quasars have reasonably similar X-ray and broadband spectra (once luminosity effects are taken into account), suggesting that the accretion mechanisms in these objects are similar. We also present near-simultaneous optical spectra for these quasars obtained with the Hobby-Eberly Telescope; this is the first time optical spectra have been published for seven of these objects. The objects presented in this paper are among the best z>4 targets for X-ray spectroscopy with XMM-Newton and next-generation, large-area X-ray telescopes. These will detect or constrain iron K$\alpha$ emission lines down to rest-frame equivalent widths of {\textasciitilde}50 eV and intrinsic column densities down to NH values roughly a few times 1021 cm-2 at z{\textasciitilde}4. We also present 45 new ROSAT upper limits for z>=4 quasars and a likely (3 $\sigma$) HRI detection of the blazar GB 1713+2148 at z=4.01.},

We update our previous results of s-process nucleosynthesis during the core He burning of these stars and then focus on an analysis of the s-process under the physical conditions encountered during the shell carbon burning. We show that the recent compilation of the 22Ne($\alpha$,n)25Mg rate leads to a remarkable reduction of the efficiency of the s-process during core He burning. In particular, this rate leads to the lowest overproduction factor of 80Kr found to date during core He burning in massive stars. The s-process yields resulting from shell carbon burning turn out to be very sensitive to the structural evolution of the carbon shell. This structure is influenced by the mass fraction of 12C attained at the end of core helium burning, which in turn is mainly determined by the 12C($\alpha$,$\gamma$)16O reaction. The still-present uncertainty in the rate for this reaction implies that the s-process in massive stars is also subject to this uncertainty. We identify some isotopes like 70Zn and 87Rb as the signatures of the s-process during shell carbon burning in massive stars. In determining the relative contribution of our s-only stellar yields to the solar abundances, we find it is important to take into account the neutron exposure of shell carbon burning. When we analyze our yields with a Salpeter initial mass function, we find that massive stars contribute at least 40% to s-only nuclei with mass A<=87. For s-only nuclei with mass A>90, massive stars contribute on average {\textasciitilde}7%, except for 152Gd, 187Os, and 198Hg, which contribute {\textasciitilde}14%, {\textasciitilde}13%, and {\textasciitilde}11%, respectively.},

abstract = {Models of rotationally driven dynamos in stellar radiative zones have suggested that magnetohydrodynamic transport of angular momentum and chemical composition can dominate over the otherwise purely hydrodynamic processes. A proper consideration of the interaction between rotation and magnetic fields is therefore essential. Previous studies have focused on a magnetic model where the magnetic field strength is derived as a function of the stellar structure and angular momentum distribution. We have adapted our one-dimensional stellar rotation code, ROSE, to model the poloidal and toroidal magnetic field strengths with a pair of time-dependent advection-diffusion equations coupled to the equations for the evolution of the angular momentum distribution and stellar structure. This produces a much more complete, though still reasonably simple, model for the magnetic field evolution. Our model reproduces well observed surface nitrogen enrichment of massive stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). In particular it reproduces a population of slowly rotating nitrogen-enriched stars that cannot be explained by rotational mixing alone alongside the traditional rotationlly enriched stars. The model further predicts a strong mass-dependency for the dynamo-driven field. Above a threshold mass, the strength of the magnetic dynamo decreases abruptly and so we predict that more massive stars are much less likely to support a dynamo-driven field than less massive stars.},

abstract = {There is now strong evidence that some stars have been born with He mass fractions as high as $Y \approx 0.40$ (e.g., in $\omega$ Centauri). However, the advanced evolution, chemical yields, and final fates of He-rich stars are largely unexplored. We investigate the consequences of He-enhancement on the evolution and nucleosynthesis of intermediate-mass asymptotic giant branch (AGB) models of 3, 4, 5, and 6 M$_\odot$ with a metallicity of $Z = 0.0006$ ([Fe/H] $\approx -1.4$). We compare models with He-enhanced compositions ($Y=0.30, 0.35, 0.40$) to those with primordial He ($Y=0.24$). We find that the minimum initial mass for C burning and super-AGB stars with CO(Ne) or ONe cores decreases from above our highest mass of 6 M$_\odot$ to $\sim$ 4-5 M$_\odot$ with $Y=0.40$. We also model the production of trans-Fe elements via the slow neutron-capture process (s-process). He-enhancement substantially reduces the third dredge-up efficiency and the stellar yields of s-process elements (e.g., 90% less Ba for 6 M$_\odot$, $Y=0.40$). An exception occurs for 3 M$_\odot$, where the near-doubling in the number of thermal pulses with $Y=0.40$ leads to $\sim$ 50% higher yields of Ba-peak elements and Pb if the $^{13}$C neutron source is included. However, the thinner intershell and increased temperatures at the base of the convective envelope with $Y=0.40$ probably inhibit the $^{13}$C neutron source at this mass. Future chemical evolution models with our yields might explain the evolution of s-process elements among He-rich stars in $\omega$ Centauri.},

Of particular interest are the two clusters M4 and M5. While at a similar metallicity ([Fe/H]{\textasciitilde}-1.2), they differ greatly in some elemental abundances: M4 is largely overabundant in Si, Ba, and La compared with M5. We find that it is also overabundant in Cu with respect to M5, although this overabundance is in accord with [Cu/Fe] ratios found in the field.},

With a luminosity of over 105 L⊙, it could also be a super asymptotic giant branch (SAGB) star, a star with an oxygen/neon core supported by electron degeneracy and undergoing thermal pulses with third dredge up. Both T{\.{Z}}Os and SAGB stars are expected to be rare. Abundances of heavy elements in HV2112's atmosphere, as observed to date, do not allow us to distinguish between the two possibilities based on the latest models. Molybdenum and rubidium can be enhanced by both the irp-process in a T{\.{Z}}O or by the s-process in SAGB stars. Lithium can be generated by hot bottom burning at the base of the convective envelope in either. HV2112's enhanced calcium could thus be the key determinant. Neither SAGB stars nor T{\.{Z}}Os are known to be able to synthesize their own calcium but it may be possible to produce it in the final stages of the process that forms a T{\.{Z}}O, when the degenerate electron core of a giant star is tidally disrupted by a neutron star.

abstract = {We present a new analysis of neutron capture occurring in low-mass asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars suffering recurrent thermal pulses. We use dedicated evolutionary models for stars of initial mass in the range 1 to 3 M⊙ and metallicity from solar to half solar. Mass loss is taken into account with the Reimers parameterization. The third dredge-up mechanism is self-consistently found to occur after a limited number of pulses, mixing with the envelope freshly synthesized 12C and s-processed material from the He intershell. During thermal pulses, the temperature at the base of the convective region barely reaches T8 {\textasciitilde} 3 (T8 being the temperature in units of 108 K), leading to a marginal activation of the 22Ne( alpha , n)25Mg neutron source. The alternative and much faster reaction 13C( alpha , n)16O must then play the major role. However, the 13C abundance l( behind by the H shell is far too low to drive the synthesis of the s-elements. We assume instead that at any third dredge-up episode, hydrogen downflows from the envelope penetrate into a tiny region placed at the top of the 12C-rich intershell, of the order of a few 10-4 M⊙. At H reignition, a 13C-rich (and 14N-rich) zone is formed. Neutrons by the major 13C source are then released in radiative conditions at T8 {\textasciitilde} 0.9 during the interpulse period, giving rise to an efficient s-processing that depends on the 13C profile in the pocket. A second small neutron burst from the 22Ne source operates during convective pulses over previously s-processed material diluted with fresh Fe seeds and H-burning ashes. The main features of the final s-process abundance distribution in the material cumulatively mixed with the envelope through the various third dredge-up episodes are discussed. Contrary to current expectations, the distribution cannot be approximated by a simple exponential law of neutron irradiations. The s-process nucleosynthesis mostly occurs inside the 13C pocket; the form of the distribution is built through the interplay of the s-processing occurring in the intershell zones and the geometrical overlap of different pulses. The 13C pocket is of primary origin, resulting from proton captures on newly synthesized 12C. Consequently, the s-process nucleosynthesis also depends on Fe seeds, a lower metallicity favoring the production of the heaviest elements. This allows a wide range of s-element abundance distributions to be produced in AGB stars of different metallicities, in agreement with spectroscopic evidence and with the Galactic enrichment of the heavy s-elements at the time of formation of the solar system. AGB stars of metallicity Z {\textasciitilde}= \frac {1}{2} Z⊙ are the best candidates for the buildup of the main component, i.e., for the s-distribution of the heavy elements from the Sr-Y-Zr peak up to the Pb peak, as deduced by meteoritic and solar spectroscopic analyses. A number of AGB stars may actually show in their envelopes an s-process abundance distribution almost identical to that of the main component. Eventually, the astrophysical origin of mainstream circumstellar SiC grains recovered from pristine meteorites, showing a nonsolar s-signatures in a number of trace heavy elements, is likely identified in the circumstellar envelopes of AGB stars of about solar metallicity, locally polluting the interstellar medium from which the solar system condensed.},

abstract = {In the context of the multiple stellar population scenario in globular clusters, helium (He) has been proposed as a key element to interpret the observed multiple main sequences, subgiant branches, and red giant branches, as well as the complex horizontal branch (HB) morphology. In particular, second-generation stars belonging to the bluer part of the HB are thought to be more He-rich ($\Delta$Y = 0.03 or more) but also more Na-rich/O-poor than those located in the redder part that should have Y equal to the cosmological value. Up to now this hypothesis was only partially confirmed in NGC 6752, where stars of the redder zero-age HB showed an He content of Y = 0.25 {\textpm} 0.01, fully compatible with the primordial He content of the universe, and were all Na-poor/O-rich. Here we study hot blue horizontal branch (BHB) stars in the GC NGC 6121 (M4) to measure their He plus O/Na content. Our goal is to complete the partial results obtained for NGC 6752, focusing our attention on targets located on the bluer part of the HB of M4. We observed six BHB stars using the VLT2/UVES spectroscopic facility. Spectra of signal-to-noise ratio {\textasciitilde} 150 were obtained and the very weak He line at 5875 {\AA} measured for all our targets. We compared this feature with synthetic spectra to obtain He abundances. In addition O, Na, and Fe abundances were estimated. Stars turned out to be all Na-rich and O-poor and to have a homogeneous He content with a mean value of Y = 0.29 {\textpm} 0.01(random) {\textpm} 0.01(systematic), which is enhanced by $\Delta$Y {\textasciitilde} 0.04 with respect to the most recent measurements of the primordial He content of the universe (Y {\textasciitilde} 0.24/0.25). The high He content of blue HB stars in M4 is also confirmed by the fact that they are brighter than red HB stars (RHB). Theoretical models suggest the BHB stars are He-enhanced by $\Delta$(Y) = 0.02/0.03 with respect to the RHB stars. The whole sample of stars has a metallicity of [Fe/H] = -1.06 {\textpm} 0.02 (internal error), in agreement with other studies available in the literature. This is a rare direct measurement of the (primordial) He abundance for stars belonging to the Na-rich/O-poor population of GC stars in a temperature regime where the He content is not altered by sedimentation or extreme mixing as suggested for the hottest, late helium flash HB stars. Our results support theoretical predictions that the Na-rich/O-poor population is also more He-rich than the Na-poor/O-rich generation and that a leading contender for the second parameter is the He abundance.

abstract = {We present elemental abundances for 855 red giant branch (RGB) stars in the globular cluster Omega Centauri ($\omega$ Cen) from spectra obtained with the Blanco 4 m telescope and Hydra multifiber spectrograph. The sample includes nearly all RGB stars brighter than V = 13.5 and spans $\omega$ Cen's full metallicity range. The heavy $\alpha$ elements (Si, Ca, and Ti) are generally enhanced by {\textasciitilde}+0.3 dex and exhibit a metallicity-dependent morphology that may be attributed to mass and metallicity-dependent Type II supernova (SN) yields. The heavy $\alpha$ and Fe-peak abundances suggest minimal contributions from Type Ia SNe. The light elements (O, Na, and Al) exhibit >0.5 dex abundance dispersions at all metallicities, and a majority of stars with [Fe/H]> - 1.6 have [O/Fe], [Na/Fe], and [Al/Fe] abundances similar to those in monometallic globular clusters, as well as O-Na, O-Al anticorrelations and the Na-Al correlation in all but the most metal-rich stars. A combination of pollution from intermediate-mass asymptotic giant branch stars and in situ mixing may explain the light element abundance patterns. A large fraction (27%) of $\omega$ Cen stars are O-poor ([O/Fe] < 0) and are preferentially located within 5'-10' of the cluster center. The O-poor giants are spatially similar, located in the same metallicity range, and are present in nearly equal proportions to blue main-sequence stars. This suggests that the O-poor giants and blue main-sequence stars may share a common origin.

abstract = {The stellar (n,$\gamma$) cross sections of Br79, Br81, Rb85, and Rb87 have been determined by a series of ten activation measurements in a quasistellar neutron spectrum corresponding to a thermal energy of kT=25 keV. The final uncertainties between 3 and 10% were dominated by the $\gamma$-ray intensities in the decay of the respective reaction products. All other uncertainties were significantly reduced through variation of the experimental parameters. The consequences of these results for s-process nucleosynthesis of Br and Rb, and in particular of the local s-only isotopes Kr80,82 and Sr86,87, are discussed with respect to the branching points at Se79 and Kr85. The contributions of both the main s component from thermally pulsing low mass asymptotic giant branch stars and the weak s component from massive stars are considered in this analysis.},

We present integral field data of this galaxy from the ANU Wide Field Spectrograph. We analyse our integral field data using optical line ratio maps and velocity maps. We apply active galactic nucleus (AGN), starburst and shock models to investigate the relative contribution from star formation, shock excitation and AGN activity to the optical emission in this key merger stage. We find that ESO 148-IG002 has a flat metallicity gradient, consistent with a recent gas inflow. We separate the line emission maps into a star-forming region with low velocity dispersion that spatially covers the whole system as well as a southern high velocity dispersion region with a coherent velocity pattern which could either be rotation or an AGN-driven outflow, showing little evidence for pure star formation. We show that the two overlapping galaxies can be separated using kinematic information, demonstrating the power of moderate spectral resolution integral field spectroscopy.},

Our sample comprises H-rich central stars of planetary nebulae as well as H-deficient PG1159 stars. We performed non-LTE calculations and find strong F overabundances (up to 10-4 by mass, i.e., 250 times solar) in a number of PG1159 stars, while F is essentially solar in the H-rich stars. Since PG1159 stars are believed to exhibit intershell matter of the preceding AGB phase on their surface, their chemical analyses allow for a direct insight into nucleosynthesis processes during the AGB phase. The high F abundances in PG1159 stars confirm the conclusion from abundance determinations in giants, that F is synthesized in AGB stars and that the F enrichment in the intershell must be very high.

abstract = {We study the role played by nucleosynthesis processes in thermal pulses and by mixing episodes (the third dredge-up) in determining the abundances of intrinsic and extrinsic asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. This is done by comparing results from AGB models with observations of s-process and CNO nuclei in C stars (N-type) and in various classes of Ba stars (Ba dwarfs, CH subgiants, and Ba II giants) with metallicities typical of the disk population. The complementary information coming from abundances of Li and Mg isotopes is also discussed. According to a generally accepted scenario, the main neutron source at the origin of s-process nucleosynthesis is assumed to be the reaction 13C($\alpha$, n)16O; a minor contribution derives also from the marginal activation of the reaction 22Ne($\alpha$, n)25Mg at the end of each flash. Making use of the latest neutron- capture cross sections and parameterizing the amount of 13C burnt per pulse, we compute the nucleosynthesis occurring in the He shell and the dredge-up of material to the surface according to recent AGB models. Using envelope abundances after the first dredge-up derived from observations of first-ascent red giants and ad opting standard prescriptions for mass loss, we succeed in fitting the photospheric compositions of C and Ba stars within their uncertainties. Our results confirm that C stars (N-type) are evolutionary descendants of normal (Tc-rich) S stars and are characterized by the same spread in mean neutron exposures (0.2-0.4 mbarn-1). As for the binary Ba stars, their abundances are compatible with the from an AGB primary component to a dwarf or giant secondary. We show that several constraints, including the Mg isotope ratios and the neutron density derived from the Rb/Sr ratio, require that s-processing occur in low-mass AGB stars but exclude the possibility that barium stars derive from primaries of intermediate mass (3 $\le$ M/Msun $\le$ 8) efficiently burning the neutron source 22Ne. The s-process enriched binary Ba giants show mean neutron exposures covering a wider range, reaching higher values (up to 1.0 mbarn-1) than for normal (single) C stars. An inverse correlation of the mean neutron exposure with metallicity is also present. Hence, the higher efficiency in s-processing shown by several Ba stars is interpreted as an indication that the metallicity range they cover is larger than for intrinsic AGB stars commonly observed. In fact, if the amount of primary 13C burnt is roughly constant for the studied stars, their effectiveness in producing neutron-rich nuclei must increase (nonlinearly) toward lower metal contents. In this scenario the exponential distributions of neutron exposures provided by low-mass AGB stars can account well for the s-process abundances observed in Population I AGB stars, with no need to invoke strong single neutron exposures, as sometimes suggested in the past.},

Observing that the ejecta which are CNO processed must also be helium enriched, we have modelled stellar evolution of globular cluster stars by taking into account this possible helium enhancement with respect to the primordial value. We show that the differences between the main evolutionary phases (main sequence, turn-off and red giants) are small enough that it would be very difficult to detect them observationally. However, the difference in the evolving mass may play a role in the morphology of the horizontal branch, and in particular in the formation of blue tails, in those globular clusters which show strong CNO abundance variations, such as M13 and NGC 6752.},

abstract = {We utilize metal-poor stars in the local, ultra-faint dwarf galaxies (UFDs; L tot <= 105 L ⊙) to empirically constrain the formation process of the first galaxies. Since UFDs have much simpler star formation histories than the halo of the Milky Way, their stellar populations should preserve the fossil record of the first supernova (SN) explosions in their long-lived, low-mass stars. Guided by recent hydrodynamical simulations of first galaxy formation, we develop a set of stellar abundance signatures that characterize the nucleosynthetic history of such an early system if it was observed in the present-day universe. Specifically, we argue that the first galaxies are the product of chemical "one-shot" events, where only one (long-lived) stellar generation forms after the first, Population III, SN explosions. Our abundance criteria thus constrain the strength of negative feedback effects inside the first galaxies. We compare the stellar content of UFDs with these one-shot criteria. Several systems (Ursa Major II, and also Coma Berenices, Bootes I, Leo IV, Segue 1) largely fulfill the requirements, indicating that their high-redshift predecessors did experience strong feedback effects that shut off star formation. We term the study of the entire stellar population of a dwarf galaxy for the purpose of inferring details about the nature and origin of the first galaxies "dwarf galaxy archaeology." This will provide clues to the connection of the first galaxies, the surviving, metal-poor dwarf galaxies, and the building blocks of the Milky Way.},

Many old, metal-poor stars show a robust abundance pattern for elements heavier than Ba, and a less robust pattern between Sr and Ag. Here we probe if two nucleosynthesis processes are sufficient to explain the stellar abundances at low metallicity, and we carry out a site independent approach to separate the contribution from these two processes or components to the total observationally derived abundances. Our approach provides a method to determine the contribution of each process to the production of elements such as Sr, Zr, Ba, and Eu. We explore the observed star-to-star abundance scatter as a function of metallicity that each process leads to. Moreover, we use the deduced abundance pattern of one of the nucleosynthesis components to constrain the astrophysical conditions of neutrino-driven winds from core-collapse supernovae.},

We encountered different regimes of neutron-capture nucleosynthesis listed here increasing in importance as the stellar mass decreases: the 22Ne($\alpha$, n)25Mg reaction activated during the thermal pulses (TPs), the 13C($\alpha$, n)16O reaction activated in radiative conditions during the interpulse periods, and the 13C($\alpha$, n)16O reaction activated during the TPs, also as a result of mild proton-ingestion episodes. The models where the 13C burns radiatively (masses sime2 M {\&}sun;) produce an overall good match to carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars showing s-process enhancements (CEMP-s), except they produce too much Na and F. On the other hand, none of our models can provide a match to the composition of CEMP stars also showing rapid-process enhancements (CEMP-s/r). The models fail to reproduce the observed Eu abundances, and they also fail to reproduce the correlation between the Eu and Ba abundances. They also cannot match the ratio of heavy-to-light s-process elements observed in many CEMP-s/r stars, which can be more than 10 times higher than in the solar system. To explain the composition of CEMP-s/r stars we need to invoke the existence of a different "s/r" neutron-capture process either with features in between the s- and the r-processes, or generated by superpositions of different neutron-capture processes in the same astrophysical site or in sites linked to each other{\textemdash}for example, in multiple stellar systems.},

This inversion may drive thermohaline mixing and thereby be responsible for the extra mixing which is observationally indicated on the red giant branch. In this paper, we investigate the physical influences that determine the mass and temperature at which the inversion in $\mu$ develops. We find that it depends most strongly on the thermal structure of the envelope - the profiles of density and temperature in the region of the star immediately above the shell - and is otherwise relatively insensitive to abundances and nuclear reaction rates. The changes in the effects of thermohaline mixing as stars proceed up the giant branch can mostly be understood in terms of their changing thermal structure, driven by their increasing core mass.},

This work reports, for the first time, the presence of these abnormal rotators among subgiant, bright giant, and Ib supergiant stars. To date, this class of stars was reported only among giant stars of luminosity class III. Most of these abnormal rotators present an IRAS infrared excess, which, in principle, can be related to dust around these stars.},

abstract = {Convergent lines of evidence suggest that globular clusters host multiple stellar populations. It appears that they experience at least two episodes of star formation whereby a fraction of first-generation stars contribute astrated ejecta to form the second generation(s). To identify the polluting progenitors, we require distinguishing chemical signatures such as that provided by lithium. Theoretical models predict that lithium can be synthesized in AGB stars, whereas no net Li production is expected from other candidates. It has been shown that in order to reproduce the abundance pattern found in M4, Li production must occur within the polluters, favoring the AGB scenario. Here, we present Li and Al abundances for a large sample of RGB stars in M12 and M5. These clusters have a very similar metallicity, while demonstrating differences in several cluster properties. Our results indicate that the first-generation and second-generation stars share the same Li content in M12; we recover an abundance pattern similar to that observed in M4. In M5, we find a higher degree of complexity, and a simple dilution model fails in reproducing the majority of the stellar population. In both clusters, we require Li production across the different stellar generations, but production seems to have occurred to different extents. We suggest that such a difference might be related to the cluster mass with the Li production being more efficient in less-massive clusters. This is the first time a statistically significant correlation between the Li spread within a GC and its luminosity has been demonstrated. Finally, although Li-producing polluters are required to account for the observed pattern, other mechanisms, such as MS depletion, might have played a role in contributing to the Li internal variation, though at a relatively low level.

abstract = {We present the first evidence of multiple populations in the Galactic globular cluster NGC 6362. We used optical and near-UV Hubble Space Telescope and ground-based photometry, finding that both the sub-giant and red giant branches are split in two parallel sequences in all color-magnitude diagrams where the F336W filter (or U band) is used. This cluster is one of the least massive globulars (M tot {\textasciitilde} 5 {\texttimes} 104 M {\&}{\#}9737;) where multiple populations have been detected so far. Even more interestingly and at odds with any previous finding, we observe that the two identified populations share the same radial distribution across the cluster extension. NGC 6362 is the first system where stars from different populations are found to be completely spatially mixed. Based on N-body and hydrodynamical simulations of multiple stellar generations, we argue that to reproduce these findings NGC 6362 should have lost up to 80% of its original mass. Based on observations collected with the NASA/ESA HST, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by AURA, Inc., under NASA contract NAS5-26555.},

abstract = {We present radial velocities, equivalent widths, model atmosphere parameters, and abundances or upper limits for 53 species of 48 elements derived from high resolution optical spectroscopy of 313 metal-poor stars. A majority of these stars were selected from the metal-poor candidates of the HK Survey of Beers, Preston, and Shectman. We derive detailed abundances for 61% of these stars for the first time. Spectra were obtained during a 10 yr observing campaign using the Magellan Inamori Kyocera Echelle spectrograph on the Magellan Telescopes at Las Campanas Observatory, the Robert G. Tull Coud{\'e} Spectrograph on the Harlan J. Smith Telescope at McDonald Observatory, and the High Resolution Spectrograph on the Hobby-Eberly Telescope at McDonald Observatory. We perform a standard LTE abundance analysis using MARCS model atmospheres, and we apply line-by-line statistical corrections to minimize systematic abundance differences arising when different sets of lines are available for analysis. We identify several abundance correlations with effective temperature. A comparison with previous abundance analyses reveals significant differences in stellar parameters, which we investigate in detail. Our metallicities are, on average, lower by $\approx$0.25 dex for red giants and $\approx$0.04 dex for subgiants. Our sample contains 19 stars with [Fe/H] <=-3.5, 84 stars with [Fe/H] <=-3.0, and 210 stars with [Fe/H] <=-2.5. Detailed abundances are presented here or elsewhere for 91% of the 209 stars with [Fe/H] <=-2.5 as estimated from medium resolution spectroscopy by Beers, Preston, and Shectman. We will discuss the interpretation of these abundances in subsequent papers. This paper includes data gathered with the 6.5 m Magellan Telescopes located at Las Campanas Observatory, Chile, and The McDonald Observatory of The University of Texas at Austin.

abstract = {We investigate the evolution of the surface properties of models for rotating massive stars, i.e., their luminosities, effective temperatures, surface rotational velocities, and surface abundances of all isotopes, from the zero-age main sequence to the supernova stage. Our results are based on the grid of stellar models by Heger, Langer, {\&} Woosley, which covers solar metallicity stars in the initial-mass range 8-25 Msolar. Results are parameterized by initial mass, initial rotational velocity and major uncertainties in the treatment of the rotational mixing inside massive stars. Rotationally induced mixing processes widen the main sequence and increase the core hydrogen-burning lifetime, similar to the effects of convective overshooting. It can also significantly increase the luminosity during and after core hydrogen burning, and strongly affects the evolution of the effective temperature. Our models predict surface rotational velocities for various evolutionary stages, in particular for blue supergiants, red supergiants, and for the immediate presupernova stage. We discuss the changes of the surface abundances due to rotationally induced mixing for main sequence and post-main-sequence stars. We single out two characteristics by which the effect of rotational mixing can be distinguished from that of massive close binary mass transfer, the only alternative process leading to nonstandard chemical surface abundances in massive stars. A comparison with observed abundance anomalies in various types of massive stars supports the concept of rotational mixing in massive stars and indicates that it is responsible for most of the observed abundance anomalies.},

We examine the role that turbulence has in the formation of gravitationally bound cores, studying the dynamical state, internal structure and bulk properties of these cores. Complex structure in turbulent clumps is formed provided that the damping time of the turbulence, tdamp, is longer than the gravitational free-fall time tff in a region. We find a variety of density and infall velocity structures among the cores in the simulation, including cores that resemble the Larson-Penston collapse of an isothermal sphere ($\rho${\textasciitilde}r-2) and cores that resemble the McLaughlin-Pudritz collapse of logatropic spheres ($\rho${\textasciitilde}r-1). The specific angular momentum profiles range between j{\textasciitilde}r1-r2. The masses of the bound cores that form fit the initial mass function, while the specific angular momentum distribution can be fit by a broken power law. While our hydrodynamic simulations reproduce many of the observed properties of cores, we find an upper limit for the star formation efficiency in clusters of 40-50 per cent.},

abstract = {We present new determinations of the iron abundance for 220 stars belonging to the stellar system Terzan 5 in the Galactic bulge. The spectra have been acquired with FLAMES at the Very Large Telescope of the European Southern Observatory and DEIMOS at the Keck II Telescope. This is by far the largest spectroscopic sample of stars ever observed in this stellar system. From this data set, a subsample of targets with spectra unaffected by TiO bands was extracted and statistically decontaminated from field stars. Once combined with 34 additional stars previously published by our group, a total sample of 135 member stars covering the entire radial extent of the system has been used to determine the metallicity distribution function of Terzan 5. The iron distribution clearly shows three peaks: a super-solar component at [Fe/H] {\textasciitilde}= 0.25 dex, accounting for {\textasciitilde}29% of the sample, a dominant sub-solar population at [Fe/H] {\textasciitilde}= {\textendash}0.30 dex, corresponding to {\textasciitilde}62% of the total, and a minor (6%) metal-poor component at [Fe/H] {\textasciitilde}= {\textendash}0.8 dex. Such a broad, multi-modal metallicity distribution demonstrates that Terzan 5 is not a genuine globular cluster but the remnant of a much more complex stellar system.

abstract = {Contrary to previous expectations, recent evolutionary models of zero-metallicity stars show that the development of mixing episodes at the beginning of the AGB phase allows low- and intermediate-mass stars to experience thermal pulses. If these stars, like their metal-rich counterparts, also experience partial mixing of protons from the H-rich envelope into the C-rich layers at the time of the third dredge-up, an extensive neutron capture nucleosynthesis leads to the production of s-process nuclei up to Pb and Bi. Nucleosynthesis calculations based on stellar AGB models are performed assuming a parameterized H-abundance profile below the convective envelope at the time of the third dredge-up. Despite the absence of Fe-group elements, the large neutron flux resulting from the \reac{13}{C}{\alpha}n{16}{O} reaction leads to an efficient production of s-process elements starting from the neutron captures on the C-Ne isotopes. Provided partial mixing of protons takes place, it is shown that population III AGB stars should be enriched in s-process elements and overall in Pb and Bi.},

Pronounced asymmetries and strong dynamical interactions between shells are seen in 2D. Although instigated by turbulence, the dynamic behavior proceeds to sufficiently large amplitudes that it couples to the nuclear burning. Dramatic growth of low-order modes is seen as well as large deviations from spherical symmetry in the burning shells. The vigorous dynamics is more violent than that seen in earlier burning stages in the three-dimensional (3D) simulations of a single cell in the oxygen burning shell, or in 2D simulations not including an active Si shell. Linear perturbative analysis does not capture the chaotic behavior of turbulence (e.g., strange attractors such as that discovered by Lorenz), and therefore badly underestimates the vigor of the instability. The limitations of 1D and 2D models are discussed in detail. The 2D models, although flawed geometrically, represent a more realistic treatment of the relevant dynamics than existing 1D models, and present a dramatically different view of the stages of evolution prior to collapse. Implications for interpretation of SN1987A, abundances in young supernova remnants, pre-collapse outbursts, progenitor structure, neutron star kicks, and fallback are outlined. While 2D simulations provide new qualitative insight, fully 3D simulations are needed for a quantitative understanding of this stage of stellar evolution. The necessary properties of such simulations are delineated.},

We find that, due to their own evolution, these rapidly rotating stars have surface abundances, effective temperatures, and luminosities that are different from normal single stars in the same evolutionary stage. This stellar population of binaries reproduces two important points of observational evidence of multiple stellar populations: a Na-O anticorrelation and multiple sequences in the HR diagram. This evidence suggests that binary interactions may be a possible scenario for the formation of multiple stellar populations in GCs.},

abstract = {Numerical experiments using a model of a 3-solar-mass star are performed to determine the physical process which limits the extent of convection during a helium flash and which seems to prohibit the convection zone from reaching the hydrogen shell. It is proposed that the maximum extent of convection is achieved when the time for radiative diffusion from the outer edge of the convection zone to the radiative region just above the hydrogen shell is shorter than the growth time of the instability. It is also suggested that this criterion should lead to quenching of the flash, since the star can then respond rapidly to entropy fluctuations in the helium shell. Computations of shell flashes with artificially altered rates of hydrogen and helium burning are found to indicate that the proposed criterion is correct. It is noted that in one calculation, an extremely violent flash resulted in contact between the convection zone and the hydrogen shell, which is not excluded by the present criterion.},

abstract = {Hyperion is a new three-dimensional dust continuum Monte-Carlo radiative transfer code that is designed to be as generic as possible, allowing radiative transfer to be computed through a variety of three-dimensional grids. The main part of the code is problem-independent, and only requires an arbitrary three-dimensional density structure, dust properties, the position and properties of the illuminating sources, and parameters controlling the running and output of the code. Hyperion is parallelized, and is shown to scale well to thousands of processes. Two common benchmark models for protoplanetary disks were computed, and the results are found to be in excellent agreement with those from other codes. Finally, to demonstrate the capabilities of the code, dust temperatures, SEDs, and synthetic multi-wavelength images were computed for a dynamical simulation of a low-mass star formation region. Hyperion is being actively developed to include new features, and is publicly available.},

abstract = {Elements heavier than the iron group are found in nearly all halo stars. A substantial number of these elements, key to understanding neutron-capture nucleosynthesis mechanisms, can only be detected in the near-ultraviolet. We report the results of an observing campaign using the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph on board the Hubble Space Telescope to study the detailed heavy-element abundance patterns in four metal-poor stars. We derive abundances or upper limits from 27 absorption lines of 15 elements produced by neutron-capture reactions, including seven elements (germanium, cadmium, tellurium, lutetium, osmium, platinum, and gold) that can only be detected in the near-ultraviolet. We also examine 202 heavy-element absorption lines in ground-based optical spectra obtained with the Magellan Inamori Kyocera Echelle Spectrograph on the Magellan-Clay Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory and the High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer on the Keck I Telescope on Mauna Kea. We have detected up to 34 elements heavier than zinc. The bulk of the heavy elements in these four stars are produced by r-process nucleosynthesis. These observations affirm earlier results suggesting that the tellurium found in metal-poor halo stars with moderate amounts of r-process material scales with the rare earth and third r-process peak elements. Cadmium often follows the abundances of the neighboring elements palladium and silver. We identify several sources of systematic uncertainty that must be considered when comparing these abundances with theoretical predictions. We also present new isotope shift and hyperfine structure component patterns for Lu II and Pb I lines of astrophysical interest. Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555. These observations are associated with programs 8111 and 12268. This paper includes data gathered with the 6.5 m Magellan Telescopes located at Las Campanas Observatory, Chile. Some of the data presented herein were obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The Observatory was made possible by the generous financial support of the W. M. Keck Foundation.},

abstract = {Recent observations for the color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of the massive globular cluster $\omega$ Centauri have shown that it has a striking double main sequence (MS), with a minority population of bluer and fainter MS stars well separated from a majority population of MS stars. Here we confirm, with the most up-to-date Y2 isochrones, that this special feature can only be reproduced by assuming a large variation ($\Delta$Y=0.15) of primordial helium abundance among several distinct populations in this cluster. We further show that the same helium enhancement required for this special feature on the MS can by itself reproduce the extreme horizontal-branch (HB) stars observed in $\omega$ Cen, which are hotter than normal HB stars. Similarly, the complex features on the HBs of other globular clusters, such as NGC 2808, are explained by large internal variations of helium abundance. Supporting evidence for the helium-rich population is also provided by the far-UV (FUV) observations of extreme HB stars in these clusters, where the enhancement of helium can naturally explain the observed fainter FUV luminosity for these stars. The presence of super-helium-rich populations in some globular clusters suggests that a third parameter, other than metallicity and age, also influences the CMD morphology of these clusters.},

abstract = {Context. Globular clusters show star-to-star abundance variations for light elements that are not yet well understood. The preferred explanation involves a self-enrichment scenario, within which two subsequent generations of stars co-exist in globular clusters. Observations of chemical abundances in the main sequence and sub-giant branch stars allow us to investigate the signature of this chemically processed material without the complicating effects caused by stellar evolution and internal mixing. Aims: Our main goal is to investigate the carbon-nitrogen anti-correlation with low-resolution spectroscopy of 20-50 stars fainter than the first dredge-up in seven Galactic globular clusters (NGC 288, NGC 1851, NGC 5927, NGC 6352, NGC 6388, and Pal 12) with different properties. We complemented our observations with 47 Tuc archival data, with four additional clusters from the literature (M 15, M 22, M 55, NGC 362), and with additional literature data on NGC 288. Methods: In this first paper, we measured the strengh of the CN and CH band indices, which correlate with the N and C abundances, and we investigated the anti-correlation and bimodality of these indices. We compared rCN, the ratio of stars belonging to the CN-strong and weak groups, with 15 different cluster parameters. Results: We clearly see bimodal anti-correlation of the CH and CN band stregths in the metal-rich clusters (Pal 12, 47 Tuc, NGC 6352, NGC 5927). Only M 15 among the metal-poor clusters shows a clearly bimodal anti-correlation. We found weak correlations (sligthly above 1$\sigma$) of rCN with the cluster orbital parameters, present-day total mass, cluster concentration, and age. Conclusions: Our findings support the self-enrichment scenario, and suggest that the occurrence of more than two major generations of stars in a GGC should be rare. Small additional generations (<10-20% of the total) would be difficult to detect with our samples. The first generation, which corresponds to the CN-weak stars, usually contains more stars than the second one (<rCN> = 0.82{\textpm}0.29), as opposed to results based on the Na-O anti-correlations.

abstract = {The chemical abundances of neon and sulfur for 25 planetary nebulae (PNe) in the Magellanic Clouds are presented. These abundances have been derived using mainly infrared data from the Spitzer Space Telescope. The implications for the chemical evolution of these elements are discussed. A comparison with similarly obtained abundances of Galactic PNe and H II regions and Magellanic Cloud H II regions is also given. The average neon abundances are 6.0{\texttimes}10-5 and 2.7{\texttimes}10-5 for the PNe in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, respectively. These are {\textasciitilde}1/3 and 1/6 of the average abundances of Galactic planetary nebulae to which we compare. The average sulfur abundances for the LMC and SMC are, respectively, 2.7{\texttimes}10-6 and 1.0{\texttimes}10-6. The Ne/S ratio (23.5) is on average higher than the ratio found in Galactic PNe (16), but the range of values in both data sets is similar for most of the objects. The neon abundances found in PNe and H II regions agree with each other. It is possible that a few (3-4) of the PNe in the sample have experienced some neon enrichment, but for two of these objects the high Ne/S ratio can be explained by their very low sulfur abundances. The neon and sulfur abundances derived in this paper are also compared to previously published abundances using optical data and photoionization models.},

abstract = {One of the leading models for the formation of multiple stellar populations within globular clusters is the `fast rotating massive star' (FRMS) scenario, where the ejecta of rapidly rotating massive stars is mixed with primordial material left over from the star formation process, to form a second generation of stars within the decretion discs of the high-mass stars. A requirement of this model, at least in its current form, is that young massive (i.e. proto-globular) clusters are not able to eject the unused gas and dust from the star formation process from the cluster for 20-30 Myr after the formation of the first generation of stars, i.e. the cluster remains embedded within the gas cloud in which it forms. Here, we test this prediction by performing a literature search for young massive clusters in nearby galaxies, which have ages less than 20 Myr that are not embedded. We report that a number of such clusters exist, with masses near or significantly above 106 M⊙, with ages between a few Myr and {\~{ }}15 Myr, suggesting that even high-mass clusters are able to clear any natal gas within them within a few Myr after formation. Additionally, one cluster, Cluster 23 in ESO 338-IG04, has a metallicity below that of some Galactic globular clusters that have been found to host multiple stellar populations, mitigating any potential effect of differences in metallicity in the comparison. The clusters reported here are in contradiction to the expectations of the FRMS scenario, at least in its current form.},

abstract = {Whether the stellar initial mass function (IMF) is universal or is instead sensitive to environmental conditions is of critical importance: The IMF influences most observable properties of stellar populations and thus galaxies, and detecting variations in the IMF could provide deep insights into the star formation process. This review critically examines reports of IMF variations, with a view toward whether other explanations are sufficient given the evidence. Studies of the field, young clusters and associations, and old globular clusters suggest that the vast majority were drawn from a universal system IMF: a power law of Salpeter index ($\Gamma$ = 1.35) above a few solar masses, and a log normal or shallower power law ($\Gamma$ {\~{ }} 0-0.25) for lower mass stars. The shape and universality of the substellar IMF is still under investigation. Observations of resolved stellar populations and the integrated properties of most galaxies are also consistent with a universal IMF, suggesting no gross variations over much of cosmic time. Indications of {\textquotedblleft}nonstandard{\textquotedblright} IMFs in specific local and extragalactic environments clearly warrant further study. However, there is no clear evidence that the IMF varies strongly and systematically as a function of initial conditions after the first few generations of stars.},

We measure 56Ni masses from the peak bolometric luminosity, then compare the luminosity in the 56Co-decay tail to the expected rate of radioactive energy release from ejecta of a given mass. We infer the ejected mass in a Bayesian context using a semi-analytic model of the ejecta, incorporating constraints from contemporary numerical models as priors on the density structure and distribution of 56Ni throughout the ejecta. We find a strong correlation between ejected mass and light-curve decline rate, and consequently 56Ni mass, with ejected masses in our data ranging from 0.9 to 1.4 M⊙. Most fast-declining (SALT2 x1 < -1) normal SNe Ia have significantly sub-Chandrasekhar ejected masses in our fiducial analysis.},

abstract = {Recent advances in constructing stellar evolution models of hydrogen-deficient post-asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars are presented. Hydrogen-deficiency can originate from mixing and subsequent convective burning of protons in the deeper layers during a thermal pulse on the post-AGB (VLTP). Dredge-up alone may also be responsible for hydrogen-deficiency of post-AGB stars. Models of the last thermal pulse on the AGB with very small envelope masses have shown efficient third dredge-up. The hydrogen content of the envelope is diluted sufficiently to produce H-deficient post-AGB stars (AFTP). Moreover, dredge-up alone may also cause H-deficiency during the Born-again phase (LTP). During the second AGB phase a convective envelope develops. A previously unknown lithium enrichment at the surface of Born-again stellar models may be used to distinguish between objects with different post-AGB evolution. The observed abundance ratios of C, O and He can be reproduced by all scenarios if an AGB starting model with inclusion of overshoot is used for the post-AGB model sequence. An appendix is devoted to the numerical methods for models of proton capture nucleosynthesis in the He-flash convection zone during a thermal pulse.},

abstract = {The colour-magnitude diagram (CMD) of NGC1851 presents two subgiant branches (SGBs), probably due to the presence of two populations differing in total C+N+O (carbon+nitrogen+oxygen) content. We test the idea that a difference in total C+N+O may simulate an age difference when comparing the CMD of clusters to derive relative ages. We compare NGC1851 with NGC6121 (M4), a cluster of very similar [Fe/H]. We find that, with a suitable shift of the CMDs that brings the two red horizontal branches at the same magnitude level, the unevolved main sequence and red giant branch match, but the SGB of NGC6121 and its red giant branch `bump' are fainter than in NGC1851. In particular, the SGB of NGC6121 is even slightly fainter than the faint SGB in NGC1851. Both these features can be explained if the total C+N+O in NGC6121 is larger than that in NGC1851, even if the two clusters are coeval. We conclude by warning that different initial C+N+O abundances between two clusters, otherwise similar in metallicity and age, may lead to differences in the turnoff morphology that can be easily attributed to an age difference.

One star exhibits the He I line; the line is weak or absent in the other star. Detailed non-local thermal equilibrium semi-empirical models including expansion in spherical geometry are developed to match the chromospheric H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, and Ca II K lines, in order to predict the helium profile and derive a helium abundance. The red giant spectra suggest a helium abundance of Y <= 0.22 (LEID 54064) and Y = 0.39-0.44 (LEID 54084) corresponding to a difference in the abundance $\Delta$Y >= 0.17. Helium is enhanced in the giant star (LEID 54084) that also contains enhanced aluminum and magnesium. This direct evaluation of the helium abundances gives observational support to the theoretical conjecture that multiple populations harbor enhanced helium in addition to light elements that are products of high-temperature hydrogen burning. We demonstrate that the 1.08 $\mu$m He I line can yield a helium abundance in cool stars when constraints on the semi-empirical chromospheric model are provided by other spectroscopic features.},

abstract = {A three-dimensional Monte Carlo code for modelling radiation transport in Type Ia supernovae is described. In addition to tracking Monte Carlo quanta to follow the emission, scattering and deposition of radiative energy, a scheme involving volume-based Monte Carlo estimators is used to allow properties of the emergent radiation field to be extracted for specific viewing angles in a multidimensional structure. This eliminates the need to compute spectra or light curves by angular binning of emergent quanta. The code is applied to two test problems to illustrate consequences of multidimensional structure on the modelling of light curves. First, elliptical models are used to quantify how large-scale asphericity can introduce angular dependence to light curves. Secondly, a model which incorporates complex structural inhomogeneity, as predicted by modern explosion models, is used to investigate how such structure may affect light-curve properties.},

abstract = {Context: PG 1159-035 is the prototype of the PG 1159 spectral class which consists of extremely hot hydrogen-deficient (pre-) white dwarfs. It is also the prototype of the GW Vir variables, which are non-radial g-mode pulsators. The study of PG 1159 stars reveals insight into stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis during AGB and post-AGB phases. Aims: We perform a quantitative spectral analysis of PG 1159-035 focusing on the abundance determination of trace elements. Methods: We have taken high-resolution ultraviolet spectra of PG 1159-035 with the Hubble Space Telescope and the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer. They are analysed with non-LTE line blanketed model atmospheres. Results: We confirm the high effective temperature with high precision ({T_eff} = 140 000 {\textpm} 5000 K) and the surface gravity of log g = 7. For the first time we assess the abundances of silicon, phosphorus, sulfur, and iron. Silicon is about solar. For phosphorus we find an upper limit of solar abundance. A surprisingly strong depletion of sulfur (2% solar) is discovered. Iron is not detected, suggesting an upper limit of 30% solar. This coincides with the Fe deficiency found in other PG 1159 stars. We redetermine the nitrogen abundance and find it to be lower by one dex compared to previous analyses. Conclusions: .The sulfur depletion is in contradiction with current models of AGB star intershell nucleosynthesis. The iron deficiency confirms similar results for other PG 1159 stars and is explained by the conversion of iron into heavier elements by n-capture in the s-processing environment of the precursor AGB star. However, the extent of the iron depletion is stronger than predicted by evolutionary models. The relatively low nitrogen abundance compared to other pulsating PG 1159 stars weakens the role of nitrogen as a distinctive feature of pulsators and non-pulsators in the GW Vir instability strip.

abstract = {The effects of rapid rotation on stellar evolution can be profound. We are now beginning to gather enough data to allow a realistic comparison between different physical models. Two key tests for any theory of stellar rotation are first whether it can match observations of the enrichment of nitrogen, and potentially other elements, in clusters containing rapid rotators; and secondly whether it can reproduce the observed broadening of the main sequence in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. Models of stellar rotation have been steadily increasing in number and complexity over the past two decades, but the lack of data makes it difficult to determine whether such additions actually give a closer reflection of reality. One of the most poorly explored features of stellar rotation models is the treatment of angular momentum transport within convective zones. If we treat the core as having uniform specific angular momentum, the angular momentum distribution in the star, for a given surface rotation, is dramatically different from what it is when we assume the star rotates as a solid body. The uniform specific angular momentum also generates strong shears which can drive additional transport of chemical elements close to the boundary of a convection zone. A comparison of different models and their reproduction of observable properties with otherwise identical input physics is essential to properly distinguish between them. We compare detailed grids of stellar evolution tracks of intermediate and high-mass stars produced using several models for rotation generated with our new stellar rotation code.},

We consider both a grid of artificial toy models which illustrate the conceivable range of effects and a recent three-dimensional hydrodynamical explosion model. We find that observationally significant viewing angle effects are likely to arise in such supernovae and that these may have important ramifications for the interpretation of the observed diversity of Type Ia supernova and the systematic uncertainties which relate to their use as standard candles in contemporary cosmology.},

abstract = {Massive young stellar objects (YSOs) are powerful infrared HI line emitters. It has been suggested that these lines form in an outflow from a disc surrounding the YSO. Here, new two-dimensional Monte Carlo radiative transfer calculations are described which test this hypothesis. Infrared spectra are synthesized for a YSO disc wind model based on earlier hydrodynamical calculations. The model spectra are in qualitative agreement with the observed spectra from massive YSOs, and therefore provide support for a disc wind explanation for the HI lines. However, there are some significant differences: the models tend to overpredict the Br$\alpha$/Br$\gamma$ ratio of equivalent widths and produce line profiles which are slightly too broad and, in contrast to typical observations, are double-peaked. The interpretation of these differences within the context of the disc wind picture and suggestions for their resolution via modifications to the assumed disc and outflow structure are discussed.},

Open clusters are thought to be chemically homogeneous internally. We aim to explore the O and Na abundance pattern among the open cluster population of the Galactic disk. Methods: We combine open cluster abundance ratios of O and Na from high-resolution spectroscopic studies in the literature and normalize them to a common solar scale. We compare the open cluster abundances against the globular clusters and disk field. Results: We find that the different environments show different abundance patterns. The open clusters do not show the O-Na anti-correlation at the extreme O-depletion/Na-enhancement as observed in globular clusters. Furthermore, the high Na abundances in open clusters do not match the disk field stars. If real, it may be suggesting that the dissolution of present-day open clusters is not a significant contribution to building the Galactic disk. Large-scale homogeneous studies of clusters and field will further confirm the reality of the Na enhancement.},

abstract = {We have compiled a sample of 699 stars from the recent literature with detailed chemical abundance information (spanning -4.2lsim [Fe/H] lsim+0.3), and we compute their space velocities and Galactic orbital parameters. We identify members of the inner and outer stellar halo populations in our sample based only on their kinematic properties and then compare the abundance ratios of these populations as a function of [Fe/H]. In the metallicity range where the two populations overlap (-2.5lsim [Fe/H] lsim-1.5), the mean [Mg/Fe] of the outer halo is lower than the inner halo by -0.1 dex. For [Ni/Fe] and [Ba/Fe], the star-to-star abundance scatter of the inner halo is consistently smaller than in the outer halo. The [Na/Fe], [Y/Fe], [Ca/Fe], and [Ti/Fe] ratios of both populations show similar means and levels of scatter. Our inner halo population is chemically homogeneous, suggesting that a significant fraction of the Milky Way stellar halo originated from a well-mixed interstellar medium. In contrast, our outer halo population is chemically diverse, suggesting that another significant fraction of the Milky Way stellar halo formed in remote regions where chemical enrichment was dominated by local supernova events. We find no abundance trends with maximum radial distance from the Galactic center or maximum vertical distance from the Galactic disk. We also find no common kinematic signature for groups of metal-poor stars with peculiar abundance patters, such as the $\alpha$-poor stars or stars showing unique neutron-capture enrichment patterns. Several stars and dwarf spheroidal systems with unique abundance patterns spend the majority of their time in the distant regions of the Milky Way stellar halo, suggesting that the true outer halo of the Galaxy may have little resemblance to the local stellar halo.},

abstract = {In this last decade, our knowledge of evolutionary and structural properties of stars of different mass and chemical composition is significantly improved. This result has been achieved as a consequence of our improved capability in understanding and describing the physical behavior of stellar matter in the different thermal regimes characteristic of the different stellar mass ranges and/or evolutionary stages. This notwithstanding, current generation of stellar models is still affected by significant and, usually, not negligible uncertainties. These uncertainties are related to our poor knowledge of some physical procceses occurring in the real stars such as, for instance, some thermodynamical processes, nuclear reaction rates, as well as the efficiency of mixing processes. These drawbacks of stellar models have to be properly taken into account when comparing theory with observations in order to derive relevant information about the properties of both resolved and unresolved stellar populations. In this paper we review current uncertainties affecting low-mass stellar models, i.e. those structures with mass in the range between 0.6Mo and 1.4Mo. We show what are the main sources of uncertainty along the main evolutionary stages, and discuss the present level of agreement between theory and observations concerning some selected features of the Color-Magnitude Diagram of low-mass stars.},

The same is true for the measurements of these isotopes and of the 26Al/27Al ratio in presolar grains of circumstellar origin. Non-convective mixing, occurring during both red giant branch (RGB) and asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stages, is the explanation commonly invoked to account for the above evidence. Recently, the need for such mixing phenomena on the AGB was questioned, and chemical anomalies usually attributed to them were suggested to be formed in earlier phases. We have therefore re-calculated extra-mixing effects in low-mass stars for both the RGB and AGB stages, in order to verify the above claims. Our results contradict them; we actually confirm that slow transport below the convective envelope occurs also on the AGB. This is required primarily by the oxygen isotopic mix and the 26Al content of presolar oxide grains. Other pieces of evidence exist, in particular from the isotopic ratios of carbon stars of type N, or C(N), in the Galaxy and in the LMC, as well as of SiC grains of AGB origin. We further show that, when extra-mixing occurs in the RGB phases of Population I stars above about 1.2 M sun, this consumes 3He in the envelope, probably preventing the occurrence of thermohaline diffusion on the AGB. Therefore, we argue that other extra-mixing mechanisms should be active in those final evolutionary phases.},

abstract = {Recent spectroscopic observations of globular clusters (GCs) in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) have discovered that one of the intermediate-age GCs, NGC 1718, with [Fe/H] = -0.7 has an extremely low [Mg/Fe] ratio of {\textasciitilde}-0.9. We propose that NGC 1718 was formed from the ejecta of Type Ia supernovae mixed with very metal-poor ([Fe/H] <-1.3) gas about {\textasciitilde}2 Gyr ago. The proposed scenario is shown to be consistent with the observed abundances of Fe-group elements such as Cr, Mn, and Ni. In addition, compelling evidence for asymptotic giant branch stars playing a role in chemical enrichment during this GC formation is found. We suggest that the origin of the metal-poor gas is closely associated with efficient gas transfer from the outer gas disk of the Small Magellanic Cloud to the LMC disk. We anticipate that the outer part of the LMC disk contains field stars exhibiting significantly low [Mg/Fe] ratios, formed through the same process as NGC 1718.},

abstract = {The origin of abundance spreads observed in omega Centauri is studied in the context of the self-enrichment scenario. Five chemical evolution models are constructed and are compared with empirical metallicity distribution of omega Cen. After a series of simulations, it is found that neither of closed-box, outflow, nor infall models can reproduce the empirical metallicity distribution of omega Cen, while a modified outflow model with a bimodal initial mass function (IMF) gives a metallicity distribution that fits closely to the empirical ones. In the modified outflow model, long-lived stars are assumed to form after the first explosion of type II supernovae (SNII) in a proto-cloud. The modified outflow model involves gas infall at the very first chemical evolution. Thus we conclude that self-enrichment causes the abundance dispersion in omega Cen. A success of the outflow model with the bimodal IMF implies that low mass stars in a globular cluster (GC) should have formed in the gas already enriched by the first generation of SNII. This scenario, originally proposed by Cayrel (1986), can explain a lack of globular clusters with [Fe/H]<{\textasciitilde} -2.2 in the Milky Way Galaxy.},

abstract = {We calculate the Type Ia supernova (SN) rate for different star formation histories in galaxies by adopting the most popular and recent progenitor models. We show that the timescale for the maximum in the SN Ia rate, which corresponds also to time of the maximum enrichment, is not unique but is a strong function of the adopted stellar lifetimes, initial mass function, and star formation rate. This timescale varies from {\textasciitilde}40-50 Myr for an instantaneous starburst to {\textasciitilde}0.3 Gyr for a typical elliptical galaxy to {\textasciitilde}4.0-5.0 Gyr for a disk of a spiral galaxy like the Milky Way. We also show that the typical timescale of 1 Gyr, often quoted as the typical timescale for the SNe Ia, is just the time at which, in the solar neighborhood, the Fe production from SNe Ia starts to become important and not the time at which SNe Ia start to explode. As a consequence of this, a change in slope in the [O/Fe] ratio is expected in correspondence of this timescale. We conclude that the suggested lack of SNe Ia at low metallicities produces results at variance with the observed [O/Fe] versus [Fe/H] relation in the solar region. We also compute the SN Ia rates for different galaxies as a function of redshift and predict an extended maximum between redshift z{\textasciitilde}3.6 and z{\textasciitilde}1.6 for elliptical galaxies, and two maxima, one at z{\textasciitilde}3 and the other at z{\textasciitilde}1, for spiral galaxies, under the assumption that galaxies start forming stars at zf{\textasciitilde}5 and $\Omega$M=0.3, $\Omega$$\Lambda$=0.7.},

UMP star observations indicate that Z >= 38 elements include the contributions of at least two nucleosynthesis components: r-process nuclei that are synthesized by rapid neutron capture in a yet unknown site and LEPP elements (mainly Sr, Y, and Zr). We show that neutrino-driven wind simulations can explain the observed LEPP pattern. We explore in detail the sensitivity of the calculated abundances to the electron fraction, which is a key nucleosynthesis parameter but poorly known due to uncertainties in neutrino interactions and transport. Our results show that the observed LEPP pattern can be reproduced in proton- and neutron-rich winds.},

abstract = {The spectro-photometric properties of galaxies in galaxy formation models are obtained by combining the predicted history of star formation and mass accretion with the physics of stellar evolution through stellar population models. In the recent literature, significant differences have emerged regarding the implementation of the thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch phase of stellar evolution. The emission in the TP-AGB phase dominates the bolometric and near-IR spectrum of intermediate-age ({\textasciitilde}1Gyr) stellar populations, hence it is crucial for the correct modelling of the galaxy luminosities and colours. In this paper, for the first time, we incorporate a full prescription of the TP-AGB phase in a semi-analytic model of galaxy formation. We find that the inclusion of the TP-AGB in the model spectra dramatically alters the predicted colour-magnitude relation and its evolution with redshift. When the TP-AGB phase is active, the rest-frame V - K galaxy colours are redder by almost 2 mag in the redshift range z {\textasciitilde} 2-3 and by 1 mag at z {\textasciitilde} 1. Very red colours are produced in disc galaxies, so that the V - K colour distributions of disc and spheroids are virtually undistinguishable at low redshifts. We also find that the galaxy K-band emission is more than 1 mag higher in the range z {\textasciitilde} 1-3. This may alleviate the difficulties met by the hierarchical clustering scenario in predicting the red galaxy population at high redshifts. The comparison between simulations and observations has to be revisited in the light of our results.},

abstract = {The majority of astrophysics involves the study of spiral galaxies, and stars and planets within them, but how spiral arms in galaxies form and evolve is still a fundamental problem. Major progress in this field was made primarily in the 1960s, and early 1970s, but since then there has been no comprehensive update on the state of the field. In this review, we discuss the progress in theory, and in particular numerical calculations, which unlike in the 1960s and 1970s, are now commonplace, as well as recent observational developments. We set out the current status for different scenarios for spiral arm formation, the nature of the spiral arms they induce, and the consequences for gas dynamics and star formation in different types of spiral galaxies. We argue that, with the possible exception of barred galaxies, spiral arms are transient, recurrent and initiated by swing amplified instabilities in the disc. We suppose that unbarred m = 2 spiral patterns are induced by tidal interactions, and slowly wind up over time. However the mechanism for generating spiral structure does not appear to have significant consequences for star formation in galaxies.},

abstract = {The MACHO data base has been used to examine light curves of all red giant stars brighter than Mbol {\textasciitilde}--2 in a 0.5 deg times 0.5 deg area of the LMC bar. Periods, often multiple, have been searched for in all stars found to be variable. Five distinct period-luminosity sequences have been found on the low mass (M <{\textasciitilde} 2.25 Modot) giant branch. Comparison of observed periods, luminosities and period ratios with theoretical models identifies Miras unambiguously as radial fundamental mode pulsators, while semi-regular variables can be pulsating in the 1st, 2nd or 3rd overtone, or even the fundamental. All these variables lie on just 3 of the 5 distinct sequences, and they all appear to be on the AGB. The fourth sequence contains red giants on the first giant branch (FGB) or at the red end of the core-helium burning loops of intermediate mass stars (M >{\textasciitilde}2.25 Modot). The light curves of these stars strongly suggest that they are contact binaries, and they make up {\textasciitilde}0.5% of stars within 1 mag. of the FGB tip. Stars on the fifth sequence show semi-regular, eclipse-like light curves. The light curves and periods of these stars suggest that they are in semi-detached binaries, transfering mass to an invisible companion via a stellar wind or Roche lobe overflow. They make up {\textasciitilde}25% of AGB stars. If the existence of these red giant contact and semi-detached binaries is confirmed, then extant theories of binary star evolution will require substantial modification.},

abstract = {Context. Recent metallicity determinations in young open clusters and star-forming regions suggest that the latter may be characterized by a slightly lower metallicity than the Sun and older clusters in the solar vicinity. However, these results are based on small statistics and inhomogeneous analyses. The Gaia-ESO Survey is observing and homogeneously analyzing large samples of stars in several young clusters and star-forming regions, hence allowing us to further investigate this issue. Aims: We present a new metallicity determination of the Chamaeleon I star-forming region, based on the products distributed in the first internal release of the Gaia-ESO Survey. Methods: The 48 candidate members of Chamaeleon I have been observed with the high-resolution, spectrograph UVES. We use the surface gravity, lithium line equivalent width, and position in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram to confirm the cluster members, and we use the iron abundance to derive the mean metallicity of the region. Results: Out of the 48 targets, we confirm 15 high probability members. Considering the metallicity measurements for nine of them, we find that the iron abundance of Chamaeleon I is slightly subsolar with a mean value [Fe/H] = -0.08 {\textpm} 0.04 dex. This result agrees with the metallicity determination of other nearby star-forming regions and suggests that the chemical pattern of the youngest stars in the solar neighborhood is indeed more metal-poor than the Sun. We argue that this evidence may be related to the chemical distribution of the Gould Belt that contains most of the nearby star-forming regions and young clusters. Based on observations collected at the ESO telescopes under programme 188.B3002, the Gaia-ESO large public spectroscopic survey.Tables 1-3 are available in electronic form at http://www.aanda.org},

abstract = {We present stellar atmosphere and evolution models of main-sequence stars in two stellar populations of the Galactic globular cluster NGC 6752. These populations represent the two extremes of light-element abundance variations in the cluster. NGC 6752 is a benchmark cluster in the study of multiple stellar populations because of the rich array of spectroscopic abundances and panchromatic Hubble Space Telescope photometry. The spectroscopic abundances are used to compute stellar atmosphere and evolution models. The synthetic spectra for the two populations show significant differences in the ultraviolet and, for the coolest temperatures, in the near-infrared. The stellar evolution models exhibit insignificant differences in the Hertzsprung-Russell (H-R) diagram except on the lower main sequence. The appearance of multiple sequences in the colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of NGC 6752 is almost exclusively due to spectral effects caused by the abundance variations. The models reproduce the observed splitting and/or broadening of sequences in a range of CMDs. The ultraviolet CMDs are sensitive to variations in carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen but the models are not reliable enough to directly estimate abundance variations from photometry. On the other hand, the widening of the lower main sequence in the near-infrared CMD, driven by oxygen variation via the water molecule, is well described by the models and can be used to estimate the range of oxygen present in a cluster from photometry. We confirm that it is possible to use multiband photometry to estimate helium variations among the different populations, with the caveat that the estimated amount of helium enhancement is model dependent.},

abstract = {Context. The post-main-sequence evolution of massive stars is very sensitive to many parameters of the stellar models. Key parameters are the mixing processes, the metallicity, the mass-loss rate, and the effect of a close companion. Aims: We study the change in the red supergiant (RSG) lifetimes, the tracks in the Hertzsprung-Russel diagram (HRD), the positions in this diagram of the pre-supernova progenitor and the structure of the stars at that time for various mass-loss rates during the RSG phase and for two different initial rotation velocities. Methods: Stellar models were computed with the Geneva code for initial masses between 9 and 25 M⊙ at solar metallicity (Z = 0.014) with 10 times and 25 times the standard mass-loss rates during the RSG phase, with and without rotation. Results: The surface abundances of RSGs are much more sensitive to rotation than to the mass-loss rates during that phase. A change of the RSG mass-loss rate has a strong impact on the RSG lifetimes and in turn on the luminosity function of RSGs. An observed RSG is associated with a model of higher initial mass when models with an enhanced RSG mass-loss rate are used to deduce that mass. At solar metallicity, models with an enhanced mass-loss rate produce significant changes in the populations of blue, yellow, and RSGs. When extended blue loops or blueward excursions are produced by enhanced mass-loss, the models predict that a majority of blue (yellow) supergiants are post-RSG objects. These post-RSG stars are predicted to show much lower surface rotational velocities than similar blue supergiants on their first crossing of the HR gap. Enhanced mass-loss rates during the RSG phase have little impact on the Wolf-Rayet populations. The position in the HRD of the end point of the evolution depends on the mass of the hydrogen envelope. More precisely, whenever at the pre-supernova stage the H-rich envelope contains more than about 5% of the initial mass, the star is a RSG, and whenever the H-rich envelope contains less than 1% of the total mass, the star is a blue supergiant. For intermediate situations, intermediate colors and effective temperatures are obtained. Yellow progenitors for core-collapse supernovae can be explained by models with an enhanced mass-loss rate, while the red progenitors are better fitted by models with the standard mass-loss rate. Tracks of the enhanced mass loss rates models are only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/575/A60},

Calculations are begun on either the zero-age main sequence or the zero-age horizontal branch, as appropriate, and include semiconvection in a simple but effective manner. The existence of convective pulses for larger masses is verified. The evolution is continued through to the thermally pulsing Asymptotic Giant Branch star. The core masses at the first pulse are found to be larger than previously estimated for masses of no more than two solar masses and smaller than estimated for masses between 2-3 solar masses. It is predicted that many stars in this mass range, especially those of lower metallicity, should begin dredging carbon to their surfaces from the first pulse. Some models have had their evolution continued until the thermal pulses reach full amplitude, enabling the derivation of a core mass-luminosity relation for this mass and abundance range. None of these models experience the third dredge-up, but this is entirely due to using alpha = 1.0. Comparison with some individual C stars shows that the models presented agree quite well with the observations, provided alpha is about 1.5.},

The reaction rates alone show that sodium will be produced by proton captures on Ne-22 in the region of a globular-cluster giant in which oxygen is being depleted. A more detailed calculation shows that significant amounts of the much more abundant Ne-20 can be transformed into Na-23 on somewhat longer time scales. Atmospheric oxygen depletions that are the result of very deep mixing are bound to be accompanied by sodium enhancements due to Ne-22 (p,gamma) Na-23 reactions; they are quite likely to be accompanied by larger sodium enhancements that begin with proton captures on Ne-20. One cannot argue that a Na-O anticorrelation is strong evidence for a primordial account of the observed variations in O and Na.},

abstract = {From a study of the integrated light properties of 200 globular clusters (GCs) in M31, Strader et al. found that the mass-to-light ratios are lower than what is expected from simple stellar population models with a `canonical' stellar initial mass function (IMF), with the discrepancy being larger at high metallicities. We use dynamical multimass models, that include a prescription for equipartition, to quantify the bias in the inferred dynamical mass as the result of the assumption that light follows mass. For a universal IMF and a metallicity-dependent present-day mass function, we find that the inferred mass from integrated light properties systematically underestimates the true mass, and that the bias is more important at high metallicities, as was found for the M31 GCs. We show that mass segregation and a flattening of the mass function have opposing effects of similar magnitude on the mass inferred from integrated properties. This makes the mass-to-light ratio as derived from integrated properties an inadequate probe of the low-mass end of the stellar mass function. There is, therefore, no need for variations in the IMF, nor the need to invoke depletion of low-mass stars, to explain the observations. Finally, we find that the retention fraction of stellar-mass black holes (BHs) is an equally important parameter in understanding the mass segregation bias. We speculatively put forward to idea that kinematical data of GCs can in fact be used to constrain the total mass in stellar-mass BHs in GCs.},

Thus, the topics that are addressed include i) the required mass of the progenitor, ii) how to form new stars in an environment already crowded by a previous stellar generation, iii) how photometry and spectroscopy appear to suggest different formation processes for second generation stars, iv) whether dilution with pristine material may (or may not) be necessary for the formation of second generations, v) why the few clusters with multiple iron abundances are after all not so different from those that are homogeneous, and finally vi) why special environmental conditions may not be necessary for the formation of globular clusters with multiple stellar generations.},

abstract = {Direct observations of the Hubble rate, from cosmic chronometers and the radial baryon acoustic oscillation scale, can outperform supernovae observations in understanding the expansion history, because supernovae observations need to be differentiated to extract H(z). We use existing H(z) data and smooth the data using a new Gaussian processes package, GaPP, from which we can also estimate derivatives. The obtained Hubble rate and its derivatives are used to reconstruct the equation of state of dark energy and to perform consistency tests of the $\Lambda$CDM model, some of which are newly devised here. Current data are consistent with the concordance model, but are rather sparse. Future observations will provide a dramatic improvement in our ability to constrain or refute the concordance model of cosmology. We produce simulated data to illustrate how effective H(z) data will be in combination with Gaussian processes.},

abstract = {The identification of the blue star PG 1159-035 as a hot, non-DA pulsating degenerate is reported. PG 1159-035 was observed by a high-speed photometer on the Multiple Mirror Telescope to obtain light curves with nearly sinusoidal variations and a peak-to-peak amplitude of about 0.02 magnitude. Power spectra of the light curves exhibit two significant peaks at frequencies of about 1.86 and 2.17 mHz, corresponding to periods of about 539 and 460 sec, respectively. Stromgren photometry indicates an effective temperature greater than 50,000 K, and an energy distribution characteristic of a Rayleigh-Jeans slope has been detected to a wavelength of 3200 A. The data thus indicate that the star is very hot, with a log of surface gravity less than about 8 and a probable depletion in surface hydrogen. The presence of two closely spaced periods in the light curve suggests that the object is a pulsating star rather than a binary, and further evidence indicates that PG 1159-035 is likely to be changing rapidly, possibly becoming a white dwarf.},

abstract = {A popular self-enrichment scenario for the formation of globular clusters assumes that the abundance anomalies seen in the stars in many clusters are due to a second stage of star formation occurring from the matter lost by the winds of massive asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. Until today, the modelings of the AGB evolution by several different groups has failed, for different reasons, to account for the patterns of chemical anomalies. Here we show that our own modeling can provide a consistent picture if we constrain the three main parameters that regulate AGB evolution, by (1) adopting a high efficiency convection model, (2) adopting rates of mass loss with a high dependence on the stellar luminosity, and (3) assuming a very small overshooting below the formal convective regions during the thermal pulse (TP) phase. The first assumption is needed to obtain an efficient oxygen depletion in the AGB envelopes, and the second is needed to lose the whole stellar envelope within few thermal pulses, so that the sum of CNO elements does not increase too much, consistent with observations. The third assumption is needed to fully understand the sodium production. We also show that the Mg-Al anticorrelation can be explained by adopting the higher limit of the NACRE rates for proton captures by 25Mg and 26Mg; the models are consistent with the recently discovered F-Al correlation. Problems remain in fully explaining the observed Mg isotope ratios.},

abstract = {Two classes of Thorne-Zytkow (TZ) stellar models are investigated: the giant models with low-mass envelopes and gravitational energy generation, and the super giant ones with more massive envelopes and nuclear energy generation. Bisnovatyi-Kogan and Lamzin (1984) argue that there is a flaw in the TZ match of the giant star's envelope onto their cores, that no equilibrium giant models will be possible when this flaw is corrected, and that such giant stars will turn out to die quickly via runaway neutrino losses and catastrophic contraction. The paper shows that Bisnovatyi-Kogan and Lamzin are mistaken: there is no flaw in the match to the core; fully self-consistent equilibrium models do exist; and the structure of those models suggests that they will be stable against neutrino-loss-triggered contraction. By contrast, there are genuine difficulties with the TZ supergiant models because their hot CNO cycle nuclear reactions get hung up waiting for beta-decays and thus have difficulty generating enough energy for hydrostatic support.

abstract = {It is indisputable that modern life is enabled by the use of materials in its technologies. Those technologies do many things very well, largely because each material is used for purposes to which it is exquisitely fitted. The result over time has been a steady increase in product performance. We show that this materials complexity has markedly increased in the past half-century and that elemental life cycle analyses characterize rates of recycling and loss. A further concern is that of possible scarcity of some of the elements as their use increases. Should materials availability constraints occur, the use of substitute materials comes to mind. We studied substitution potential by generating a comprehensive summary of potential substitutes for 62 different metals in all their major uses and of the performance of the substitutes in those applications. As we show herein, for a dozen different metals, the potential substitutes for their major uses are either inadequate or appear not to exist at all. Further, for not 1 of the 62 metals are exemplary substitutes available for all major uses. This situation largely decouples materials substitution from price, thereby forcing material design changes to be primarily transformative rather than incremental. As wealth and population increase worldwide in the next few decades, scientists will be increasingly challenged to maintain and improve product utility by designing new and better materials, but doing so under potential constraints in resource availability.},

abstract = {Using three-dimensional cosmological simulations, we study the assembly process of one of the first galaxies, with a total mass of {\textasciitilde}108 M sun, collapsing at z {\textasciitilde}= 10. Our main goal is to trace the transport of the heavy chemical elements produced and dispersed by a pair-instability supernova exploding in one of the minihalo progenitors. To this extent, we incorporate an efficient algorithm into our smoothed particle hydrodynamics code that approximately models turbulent mixing as a diffusion process. We study this mixing with and without the radiative feedback from Population III (Pop III) stars that subsequently form in neighboring minihalos. Our simulations allow us to constrain the initial conditions for second-generation star formation, within the first galaxy itself, and inside of minihalos that virialize after the supernova explosion. We find that most minihalos remain unscathed by ionizing radiation or the supernova remnant, while some are substantially photoheated and enriched to supercritical levels, likely resulting in the formation of low-mass Pop III or even Population II (Pop II) stars. At the center of the newly formed galaxy, {\textasciitilde}105 M sun of cold, dense gas uniformly enriched to {\textasciitilde}10-3 Z sun is in a state of collapse, suggesting that a cluster of Pop II stars will form. The first galaxies, as may be detected by the James Webb Space Telescope, would therefore already contain stellar populations familiar from lower redshifts.},

abstract = {Aims: The aim of this paper is to investigate the evolution of the 12C/13C ratio along the AGB through the circumstellar 12CO/13CO abundance ratio. This is the first time a sample including a significant number of M- and S-type stars is analysed together with a carbon-star sample of equal size, making it possible to investigate trends among the different types and establish evolutionary effects. Methods: The circumstellar 12CO/13CO abundance ratios are estimated through a detailed radiative transfer analysis of single-dish radio line emission observations. Several different transitions have been observed for each source to ensure that a large extent of the circumstellar envelope is probed and the radiative transfer model is well constrained. The radiative transfer model is based on the Monte Carlo method and has been benchmarked against a set of similar codes. It assumes that the radiation field is non-local and solves the statistical equilibrium equations in full non-local thermodynamic equilibrium. The energy balance equation, determining the gas temperature distribution, is solved self-consistently, and the effects of thermal dust radiation (as estimated from the spectral energy distribution) are taken into account. First, the 12CO radiative transfer is solved, assuming an abundance (dependent on the chemical type of the star), to give the physical parameters of the gas, i.e. mass-loss rate, {\.{M}}, gas expansion velocity, $\upsilon$e, and gas temperature distribution. Then, the 13CO radiative transfer is solved using the results of the 12CO model giving the 13CO abundance. Finally, the 12CO/13CO abundance ratio is calculated. Results: The circumstellar 12CO/13CO abundance ratio differs between the three spectral types. This is consistent with what is expected from stellar evolutionary models assuming that the spectral types constitute an evolutionary sequence; however, this is the first time this has been shown observationally for a relatively large sample covering all three spectral types. The median value of the 13CO abundance in the inner circumstellar envelope is 1.6 {\texttimes} 10-5, 2.3 {\texttimes} 10-5, and 3.0 {\texttimes} 10-5 for the M-type, S-type, and carbon stars of the sample, respectively, corresponding to 12CO/13CO abundance ratios of 13, 26, and 34, respectively. The spread in the 13CO abundance, quantified by the ratio between the 90th and 10th percentile, is 4, 3, and 15 for the M-type, S-type, and carbon stars, respectively. Interestingly, the abundance ratio spread of the carbon stars is much larger than for the M- and S-type stars, even when excluding J-type carbon stars, in line with what could be expected from evolution on the AGB. We find no correlation between the isotopologue ratio and the mass-loss rate, as would be expected if both increase as the star evolves.

abstract = {There are no good predictions for the amplitudes expected from solar-like oscillations in other stars. In the absence of a definitive model for convection, which is thought to be the mechanism that excites these oscillations, the amplitudes for both velocity and luminosity measurements must be estimated by scaling from the Sun. In the case of luminosity measurements, even this is difficult because of disagreement over the solar amplitude. This last point has lead us to investigate whether the luminosity amplitude of oscillations $\delta$L/L can be derived from the velocity amplitude (v_osc_). Using linear theory and observational data, we show that p-mode oscillations in a large sample of pulsating stars satisfy ($\delta$L/L)_bol_{prop.to} v_osc_/T_eff_. Using this relationship, together with the best estimate of v_osc_,sun_=(23.4+/-1.4)cm/s, we estimate the luminosity amplitude of solar oscillations at 550nm to be $\delta$L/L=(4.7+/-0.3)ppm. Next we discuss how to scale the amplitude of solar-like (i.e., convectively-powered) oscillations from the Sun to other stars. The only predictions come from model calculations by Christensen-Dalsgaard {\&} Frandsen (1983, Sol. Phys. 82, 469). However, their grid of stellar models is not dense enough to allow amplitude predictions for an arbitrary star. Nevertheless, although convective theory is complicated, we might expect that the general properties of convection - including oscillation amplitudes - should change smoothly through the colour-magnitude diagram. Indeed, we find that the velocity amplitudes predicted by the model calculations are well fitted by the relation v_osc_{prop.to}L/M. These two relations allow us to predict both the velocity and luminosity amplitudes of solar-like oscillations in any given star. We compare these predictions with published observations and evaluate claims for detections that have appeared in the literature. We argue that there is not yet good evidence for solar-like oscillations in any star except the Sun. For solar-type stars (e.g., $\alpha$ Cen A and $\beta$ Hyi), observations have not yet reached sufficient sensitivity to detect the amplitudes we predict. For some F-type stars, namely Procyon and several members of M67, detection sensitivities 30-40% below the predicted amplitudes have been achieved. We conclude that these stars must oscillate with amplitudes less than has generally been assumed.},

abstract = {Aims: We present abundance analysis based on high resolution spectra of 105 isolated red giant branch (RGB) stars in the Galactic Globular Cluster NGC 6121 (M 4). Our aim is to study its star population in the context of the multi-population phenomenon recently discovered to affect some Globular Clusters. Methods: The data have been collected with FLAMES+UVES, the multi-fiber high resolution facility at the ESO/VLT@UT2 telescope. Analysis was performed under LTE approximation for the following elements: O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, Cr, Fe, Ni, Ba, and NLTE corrections were applied to those (Na, Mg) strongly affected by departure from LTE. Spectroscopic data were coupled with high-precision wide-field UBVIC photometry from WFI@2.2 m telescope and infrared JHK photometry from 2MASS. Results: We derived an average [Fe/H] = -1.07{\textpm}0.01 (internal error), and an $\alpha$ enhancement of [$\alpha$/Fe] = +0.39{\textpm}0.05 dex (internal error). We confirm the presence of an extended Na-O anticorrelation, and find two distinct groups of stars with significantly different Na and O content. We find no evidence of a Mg-Al anticorrelation. By coupling our results with previous studies on the CN band strength, we find that the CN strong stars have higher Na and Al content and are more O depleted than the CN weak ones. The two groups of Na-rich, CN-strong and Na-poor, CN-weak stars populate two different regions along the RGB. The Na-rich group defines a narrow sequence on the red side of the RGB, while the Na-poor sample populate a bluer, more spread portion of the RGB. In the {U} vs. {U-B} color magnitude diagram the RGB spread is present from the base of the RGB to the RGB-tip. Apparently, both spectroscopic and photometric results imply the presence of two stellar populations in M 4. We briefly discuss the possible origin of these populations.

abstract = {This paper is concerned with stellar neutron capture processes which occur at a rate slow compared to the intervening beta decays, the so-called s-process in the synthesis of the elements. An approximate method of high reliability has been devised to solve for the abundance distributions resulting from the exposure of seed nuclei, such as Fe 56, to a weak neutron flux in stars. The capture chain differential equations are solved by approximately matching the Laplace transforms of the exact solutions to the Laplace transform of an easily calculable function. From the sequence of abundance distributions generated in this manner for specified numbers of neutrons per initial seed nucleus, one can estimate the superpositions of neutron exposures required to reproduce the experimentally observed abundance distribution for the s-process isotopes of the elemments. Not only can the validity of the s-process model of heavy element synthesis in stellar interiors be demonstrated in this way, but certain inferences about the "history" of stellar neutron processes also appear. Special attention is paid in this regard to the "terminal" exposures which have synthesized lead and bismuth at the end of the line in the s-process. An analysis is appended of neutron capture cross sections near 25 kev for the s-process nuclei, including interpolations based upon empirical cross sections guided where necessary by isotopic and elemental abundances. A complete correlation between neutron capture cross sections and s-process abundances cannot be made at the present stage of knowledge, but the methods described will lead to an eventual solution as more empirical information becomes available.},

Here, we present Very Large Telescope and Public ESO Spectroscopic Survey of Transient Objects observations of this SN in the nebular phase. We model the nebular [O I] $\lambda$$\lambda$6300, 6364 lines and find their strength to suggest a progenitor main-sequence mass of 13-15 M⊙. SN 2012ec is unique among hydrogen-rich SNe in showing a distinct line of stable nickel [Ni II] $\lambda$7378. This line is produced by 58Ni, a nuclear burning ash whose abundance is a sensitive tracer of explosive burning conditions. Using spectral synthesis modelling, we use the relative strengths of [Ni II] $\lambda$7378 and [Fe II] $\lambda$7155 (the progenitor of which is 56Ni) to derive a Ni/Fe production ratio of 0.20 {\textpm} 0.07 (by mass), which is a factor 3.4 {\textpm} 1.2 times the solar value. High production of stable nickel is confirmed by a strong [Ni II] 1.939 $\mu$m line. This is the third reported case of a core-collapse SN producing a Ni/Fe ratio far above the solar value, which has implications for core-collapse explosion theory and galactic chemical evolution models.},

abstract = {We have compiled a sample of globular clusters with high-quality stellar abundances from the literature to compare to the chemistries of stars in the Galaxy and in dwarf spheroidal galaxies. Of the 45 globular clusters examined, 29 also have kinematic information. Most of the globular clusters belong to the Galactic halo; however, a significant number have disk kinematics or belong to the bulge. Focusing on the [$\alpha$/Fe] and light r-process element ratios, we find that most globular cluster stars mimic field stars of similar metallicities, and neither clearly resembles the currently available stellar abundances in dwarf galaxies (including globular clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud). The exceptions to these general elemental ratio comparisons are already known in the literature, e.g., $\omega$ Centauri, Palomar 12, and Terzan 7 associated with the Sagittarius remnant and Ruprecht 106, which has a high radial velocity and low [$\alpha$/Fe] ratio. A few other globular clusters show more marginal peculiarities. The most notable one is the halo cluster M68, which has a high galactocentric rotational velocity, a slightly younger age, and a unique [Si/Ti] ratio. The [Si/Ti] ratios decrease with increasing [Fe/H] at intermediate metallicities, which is consistent with very massive stars playing a larger role in the early chemical evolution of the Galaxy. The chemical similarities between globular clusters and field stars with [Fe/H]<=-1.0 suggests a shared chemical history in a well-mixed early Galaxy. The differences in the published chemistries of stars in the dwarf spheroidal galaxies suggest that neither the globular clusters, halo stars, nor thick disk stars had their origins in small isolated systems like the present-day Milky Way dwarf satellites.},

abstract = {Very high quality spectra of 24 metal-poor halo dwarfs and subgiants have been acquired with ESO's VLT/UVES for the purpose of determining Li isotopic abundances. The derived one-dimensional, non-LTE 7Li abundances from the Li I 670.8 nm line reveal a pronounced dependence on metallicity but with negligible scatter around this trend. Very good agreement is found between the abundances from the Li I 670.8 nm line and the Li I 610.4 nm line. The estimated primordial 7Li abundance is 7Li/H=(1.1-1.5){\texttimes}10-10, which is a factor of 3-4 lower than predicted from standard big bang nucleosynthesis with the baryon density inferred from the cosmic microwave background. Interestingly, 6Li is detected in 9 of our 24 stars at the >=2 $\sigma$ significance level. Our observations suggest the existence of a 6Li plateau at the level of loge6Li{\textasciitilde}0.8 however, taking into account predictions for 6Li destruction during the pre-main-sequence evolution tilts the plateau such that the 6Li abundances apparently increase with metallicity. Our most noteworthy result is the detection of 6Li in the very metal-poor star LP 815-43. Such a high 6Li abundance during these early Galactic epochs is very difficult to achieve by Galactic cosmic-ray spallation and $\alpha$-fusion reactions. It is concluded that both Li isotopes have a pre-Galactic origin. Possible 6Li production channels include protogalactic shocks and late-decaying or annihilating supersymmetric particles during the era of big bang nucleosynthesis. The presence of 6Li limits the possible degree of stellar 7Li depletion and thus sharpens the discrepancy with standard big bang nucleosynthesis. Based on observations collected at the European Southern Observatory, Paranal, Chile (observing programs 65.L-0131, 68.D-0091, and 273.D-5043).},

abstract = {Observations of planetary nebulae (PNe) in the work of Sterling, Dinerstein, {\&} Bowers have revealed abundances in the neutron-capture element germanium (Ge) from solar to factors of 3-10 above solar. The enhanced Ge is an indication that the slow neutron-capture process (the s-process) operated in the parent star during the thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch (TP-AGB) phase. We compute the detailed nucleosynthesis of a series of AGB models to estimate the surface enrichment of Ge near the end of the AGB. A partial mixing zone of constant mass is included at the deepest extent of each dredge-up episode, resulting in the formation of a 13C pocket in the top approximately one-tenth of the He-rich intershell. All of the models show surface increases of [Ge/Fe] <{\textasciitilde} 0.5, except the 2.5 Msolar, Z=0.004 case, which produced a factor of 6 enhancement of Ge. Near the tip of the TP-AGB, a couple of extra thermal pulses (TPs) could occur to account for the composition of the most Ge-enriched PNe. Uncertainties in the theoretical modeling of AGB stellar evolution might account for larger Ge enhancements than we predict here. Alternatively, a possible solution could be provided by the occurrence of a late TP during the post-AGB phase. Difficulties related to spectroscopic abundance estimates also need to be taken into consideration. Further study is required to better assess how the model uncertainties affect the predictions and, consequently, if a late TP should be invoked.},

abstract = {The Octans association is one of several young stellar moving groups recently discovered in the Solar neighbourhood and hence a valuable laboratory for studies of stellar, circumstellar disc and planetary evolution. However, a lack of low-mass members or any members with trigonometric parallaxes means the age, distance and space motion of the group are poorly constrained. To better determine its membership and age, we present the first spectroscopic survey for new K- and M-type Octans members, resulting in the discovery of 29 UV-bright K5-M4 stars with kinematics, photometry and distances consistent with existing members. Nine new members possess strong Li I $\lambda$6708 absorption, which allow us to estimate a lithium age of 30-40 Myr, similar to that of the Tucana-Horologium association and bracketed by the firm lithium depletion boundary ages of the $\beta$ Pictoris (20 Myr) and Argus/IC 2391 (50 Myr) associations. Several stars also show hints in our medium-resolution spectra of fast rotation or spectroscopic binarity. More so than other nearby associations, Octans is much larger than its age and internal velocity dispersion imply. It may be the dispersing remnant of a sparse, extended structure which includes some younger members of the foreground Octans-Near association recently proposed by Zuckerman and collaborators.},

We confirm the decrease in 25Mg/24Mg and 26Mg/24Mg with decreasing [Fe/H], as predicted by recent models of Galactic chemical evolution in which the Mg isotopes are produced in massive stars. A subset of kinematically identified thin-disk stars have Mg isotope ratios in excellent agreement with the predictions. Within the measurement uncertainties, these thin-disk stars show no scatter about the predictions. Several of our stars are likely members of the thick disk, and their high Mg isotopic ratios may reflect the nucleosynthetic history of the thick disk, which is distinct from the predictions for, and observations of, the thin disk. For thick-disk and halo stars we find a scatter in 25Mg/24Mg and 26Mg/24Mg exceeding our measurement uncertainties and increasing with increasing metallicity. Our data suggest that an additional source of 25Mg and 26Mg is required. Intermediate-mass asymptotic giant branch stars are likely candidates.},

abstract = {Aims: We present new measurements of the abundances of carbon and oxygen derived from high-excitation C i and O i absorption lines in metal-poor halo stars, with the aim of clarifying the main sources of these two elements in the early stages of the chemical enrichment of the Galaxy. Methods: We target 15 new stars compared to our previous study, with an emphasis on additional C/O determinations in the crucial metallicity range -3 ⪉ [Fe/H]⪉ -2. The stellar effective temperatures were estimated from the profile of the H$\beta$ line. Departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium were accounted for in the line formation for both carbon and oxygen. The non-LTE effects are very strong at the lowest metallicities but, contrary to what has sometimes been assumed in the past due to a simplified assessment, of different degrees for the two elements. In addition, for the 28 stars with [Fe/H] < -1 previously analysed, stellar parameters were re-derived and non-LTE corrections applied in the same fashion as for the rest of our sample, giving consistent abundances for 43 halo stars in total. Results: The new observations and non-LTE calculations strengthen previous suggestions of an upturn in C/O towards lower metallicity (particularly for [O/H] ⪉ -2). The C/O values derived for these very metal-poor stars are, however, sensitive to excitation via the still poorly quantified inelastic H collisions. While these do not significantly affect the non-LTE results for C i, they greatly modify the O i outcome. Adopting the H collisional cross-sections estimated from the classical Drawin formula leads to [C/O] $\approx$ 0 at [O/H] $\approx$ -3. To remove the upturn in C/O, near-LTE formation for O i lines would be required, which could only happen if the H collisional efficiency with the Drawin recipe is underestimated by factors of up to several tens of times, a possibility which we consider unlikely. Conclusions: The high C/O values derived at the lowest metallicities may be revealing the fingerprints of Population III stars or may signal rotationally-aided nucleosynthesis in more normal Population II stars. Based on data collected with the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope (VLT) at the Paranal, Chile (programmes No. 67.D-0106 and 73.D-0024) and with the Magellan Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory, Chile.},

We describe the code, our calculation of photoionization, heating and cooling, and the approximations we have employed for the low-density HII regions we wish to study. Our code gives results in agreement with the Lexington HII region benchmarks. We show an example of a two-dimensional shadowed region and point out the very significant effect that diffuse radiation produced by recombinations of He has on the temperature within the shadow.},

C10.1103/PhysRevC.80.035801 80, 035801 (2009)] that a suppression of the stellar enhancement factor (SEF) occurs in some endothermic reactions at and far from stability. This effect is re-evaluated using the ground-state contributions to the stellar reaction rates, which were shown to be better suited to judging the importance of excited-state contributions than the previously applied SEFs. An update of the tables shown in the latter work is given. The new evaluation finds 2350 cases (out of a full set of 57 513 reactions) for which the ground-state contribution is larger in the reaction direction with a negative reaction Q value than in the exothermic direction, thus providing exceptions to the commonly applied Q value rule. The results confirm the Coulomb suppression effect but lead to a larger number of exceptions than previously found. This is due to the fact that often a large variation in the g.s. contribution does not lead to a sizable change in the SEF. On the other hand, several previously identified cases do not appear anymore because it is found that their g.s. contribution is smaller than inferred from the SEF.},

abstract = {The High-Z Supernova Search is an international collaboration to discover and monitor Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) at z > 0.2 with the aim of measuring cosmic deceleration and global curvature. Our collaboration has pursued a basic understanding of supernovae in the nearby universe, discovering and observing a large sample of objects and developing methods to measure accurate distances with SNe Ia. This paper describes the extension of this program to z >= 0.2, outlining our search techniques and follow-up program. We have devised high-throughput filters that provide accurate two-color rest frame B and V light curves of SNe Ia, enabling us to produce precise, extinction-corrected luminosity distances in the range 0.25 < z < 0.55. Sources of systematic error from K-corrections, extinction, selection effects, and evolution are investigated, and their effects estimated. We present photometric and spectral observations of SN 1995K, our program's first supernova (SN), and use the data to obtain a precise measurement of the luminosity distance to the z = 0.479 host galaxy. This object, when combined with a nearby sample of SNe, yields an estimate for the matter density of the universe of Omega_M=-0.2^+1.0_-0.8 if Omega_Lambda = 0. For a spatially flat universe composed of normal matter and a cosmological constant, we find Omega_M=0.4^+0.5_-0.4, Omega_Lambda=0.6^+0.4_-0.5. We demonstrate that with a sample of {\textasciitilde}30 objects, we should be able to determine relative luminosity distances over the range 0 < z < 0.5 with sufficient precision to measure Omega_M with an uncertainty of +/-0.2.},

abstract = {We present the results of analysis of "snapshot" spectra of 253 metal-poor halo stars -3.8$\le$ [Fe/H] $\le$ -1.5 obtained in the HERES survey. The snapshot spectra have been obtained with VLT/UVES and have typically S/N{\~{ }} 54 per pixel (ranging from 17 to 308), R{\~{ }}20 000, $\lambda$ = 3760-4980 {\AA}. This sample represents the major part of the complete HERES sample of 373 stars; however, the CH strong content of the sample is not dealt with here. The spectra are analysed using an automated line profile analysis method based on the Spectroscopy Made Easy (SME) codes of Valenti {\&} Piskunov. Elemental abundances of moderate precision (absolute rms errors of order 0.25 dex, relative rms errors of order 0.15 dex) have been obtained for 22 elements, C, Mg, Al, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Zn, Sr, Y, Zr, Ba, La, Ce, Nd, Sm, and Eu, where detectable. Of these elements, 14 are usually detectable at the 3$\sigma$ confidence level for our typical spectra. The remainder can be detected in the least metal-poor stars of the sample, spectra with higher than average S/N, or when the abundance is enhanced. Among the sample of 253 stars, disregarding four previously known comparison stars, we find 8 r-II stars and 35 r-I stars. The r-II stars, including the two previously known examples CS 22892-052 and CS 31082-001, are centred on a metallicity of [Fe/H] = -2.81, with a very small scatter, on the order of 0.16 dex. The r-I stars are found across practically the entire metallicity range of our sample. We also find three stars with strong enhancements of Eu which are s-process rich. A significant number of new very metal-poor stars are confirmed: 49 stars with [Fe/H]<-3 and 181 stars with -3<[Fe/H]<-2. We find one star with [Fe/H]<-3.5. We find the scatter in the abundance ratios of Mg, Ca, Sc, Ti, Cr, Fe, Co, and Ni, with respect to Fe and Mg, to be similar to the estimated relative errors and thus the cosmic scatter to be small, perhaps even non-existent. The elements C, Sr, Y, Ba and Eu, and perhaps Zr, show scatter at [Fe/H] ⪉ -2.5 significantly larger than can be explained from the errors in the analysis, implying scatter which is cosmic in origin. Significant scatter is observed in abundance ratios between light and heavy neutron-capture elements at low metallicity and low levels of r-process enrichment.},

abstract = {Context. Barium stars are moderately rare, chemically peculiar objects, which are believed to be the result of the pollution of an otherwise normal star by material from an evolved companion on the asymptotic giant branch (AGB). Aims: We aim to derive carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and fluorine abundances for the first time from the infrared spectra of the barium red giant star HD 123396 to quantitatively test AGB nucleosynthesis models for producing barium stars via mass accretion. Methods: High-resolution and high S/N infrared spectra were obtained using the Phoenix spectrograph mounted at the Gemini South telescope. The abundances were obtained through spectrum synthesis of individual atomic and molecular lines, using the MOOG stellar line analysis program, together with Kurucz's stellar atmosphere models. The analysis was classical, using 1D stellar models and spectral synthesis under the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium. Results: We confirm that HD 123396 is a metal-deficient barium star ([Fe/H] = -1.05), with A(C) = 7.88, A(N) = 6.65, A(O) = 7.93, and A(Na) = 5.28 on a logarithmic scale where A(H) = 12, leading to [(C+N)/Fe] $\approx$ 0.5. The A(CNO) group, as well as the A(Na) abundances, is in excellent agreement with those previously derived for this star using high-resolution optical data. We also found A(F) = 4.16, which implies [F/O] = 0.39, a value that is substantially higher than the F abundances measured in globular clusters of a similar metallicity, noting that there are no F measurements in field stars of comparable metallicity. Conclusions: The observed abundance pattern of the light elements (CNO, F, and Na) recovered here as well as the heavy elements (s-process) studied elsewhere suggest that the surface composition of HD 123396 is well fitted by the predicted abundance pattern of a 1.5 M⊙ AGB model star with Z = 0.001. Thus, the AGB mass transfer hypothesis offers a quantitatively viable framework.},

We evolve the models from the pre-main sequence to the thermally-pulsing asymptotic giant branch phase. We have two sequences of models for each mass, one which includes mass loss and one without mass loss. Typically 20 or more pulses have been followed for each model, allowing us to calculate the third dredge-up parameter for each case. Using the results from this large and homogeneous set of models, we present an approximate fit for the core mass at the first thermal pulse, Mc1, as well as for the third dredge-up efficiency parameter, $\lambda$, and the core mass at the first dredge-up episode, Mcmin, as a function of metallicity and total mass. We also examine the effect of a reduced envelope mass on the value of $\lambda$.},

abstract = {Context. Small amplitude oscillations are observed in red giant branch (RGB) stars. Data on such oscillations are a source of information about the objects, notably about properties of convection in their envelopes and about the systems these objects inhabit. The OGLE-III catalog contains data for about 80 thousand small amplitude variable red giants (OSARGs) in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Aims: We want to explain variability oin OSARGs as the solar-like oscillation and to associate the peaks in power spectra with frequencies of acoustic modes. Methods: We use data on reddening-free magnitudes of the objects and interpret them in terms of stellar physical parameters using tabulated isochrones calculated for ages and composition parameters corresponding to the upper RGB of the LMC. Massive data on the peak frequencies and amplitudes are compared with expectations for stochastically excited oscillations. The frequencies are also compared with those calculated for radial modes in envelope models with parameters taken from the isochrones. Results: In stars close to the tip of the RGB, the peaks in power spectra are found in the 0.1-1.0 $\mu$Hz range, which is consistent with extrapolation of the frequency-luminosity relation for the solar-like oscillation. The dominant peaks occur close to the first two radial overtones. The increase in amplitude with luminosity is slower than linear. The exponent s $\approx$ 0.9 is similar to what is found from recent analysis of CoRoT data on less luminous red giants. Frequency separations between dominant peaks are found to be smaller by about 20% than calculated separations between these modes. After examining various possibilities, we left this discrepancy unexplained. Conclusions: The small amplitude variability of stars at the RGB tip is likely to be caused by a stochastic excitation of acoustic oscillations but interpreting of individual peaks in power spectra presents a problem.},

abstract = {The globular cluster M15 is unique in its display of star-to-star variations in the neutron-capture elements. Comprehensive abundance surveys have been previously conducted for handfuls of M15 red giant branch (RGB) and red horizontal branch (RHB) stars. No attempt has been made to perform a single, self-consistent analysis of these stars, which exhibit a wide range in atmospheric parameters. In the current effort, a new comparative abundance derivation is presented for three RGB and six RHB members of the cluster. The analysis employs an updated version of the line transfer code MOOG, which now appropriately treats coherent, isotropic scattering. The apparent discrepancy in the previously reported values for the metallicity of M15 RGB and RHB stars is addressed and a resolute disparity of $\Delta$(RHB - RGB) $\approx$ 0.1 dex in the iron abundance was found. The anti-correlative behavior of the light neutron-capture elements (Sr, Y, Zr) is clearly demonstrated with both Ba and Eu, standard markers of the s- and r-process, respectively. No conclusive detection of Pb was made in the RGB targets. Consequently for the M15 cluster, this suggests that the main component of the s-process has made a negligible contribution to those elements normally dominated by this process in solar system material. Additionally for the M15 sample, a large Eu abundance spread is confirmed, which is comparable to that of the halo field at the same metallicity. These abundance results are considered in the discussion of the chemical inhomogeneity and nucleosynthetic history of M15.},

abstract = {We find that the globular cluster (GC) systems of the Milky Way and of our neighboring spiral galaxy, M31, comprise two distinct entities, differing in three respects. First, M31 has a set of young GCs, ranging in age from a few times 102 Myr to 5 Gyr old, as well as old GCs. No such very young GCs are known in the Milky Way. Second, we confirm that the oldest M31 GCs have much higher nitrogen abundances than do Galactic GCs at equivalent metallicities, while carbon abundances appear normal for the GCs in both galaxies. Third, Morrison and coworkers have shown that M31 has a subcomponent of GCs that follow closely the disk rotation curve of that galaxy. Such a GC system in our own Galaxy has yet to be found. The only plausible scenario for the existence of the young M31 GC comes from the hierarchical-clustering-merging (HCM) paradigm for galaxy formation. We infer that M31 has absorbed more of its contingent of dwarf systems in the recent past than has the Milky Way. This inference has three implications: First, all spiral galaxies could differ in their GC properties, depending on how many companions each galaxy has and when the parent galaxy absorbs them. In this spectrum of possibilities, apparently the Milky Way ties down one end, in which almost all of its GCs were absorbed 10-12 Gyr ago. Second, it suggests that young GCs are preferentially formed in the dwarf companions of parent galaxies and then absorbed by the parent galaxy during mergers. Third, the young GCs seen in tidally interacting galaxies might come from the dwarf companions of these galaxies, rather than be made anew in the tidal interaction. However, there is no ready explanation for the marked difference in nitrogen abundance for the stars in the old M31 GCs relative to those in the oldest Galactic GCs, especially the most metal-poor GCs in both galaxies. The predictions made by Li {\&} Burstein regarding the origin of nitrogen abundance in GCs are consistent with what is found for the old M31 GCs compared to that for the two 5 Gyr old M31 GCs. Observations reported here were obtained at the MMT Observatory, a joint facility of the Smithsonian Institution and the University of Arizona.},

The great majority of the Li-rich and low 12C/13C stars are of J type, although this correlation can also be found in normal (N-type) C stars. If these stars were indeed low-mass C stars, these results would require the existence of a deep-mixing mechanism able to operate in low-mass (M ⪉ 2 Msun) C stars as an alternative for Li production by the hot bottom burning mechanism proposed in asymptotic giant branch stars with larger mass. We show observational evidence suggesting that high mass loss appears to act against such a mechanism.},

abstract = {The DUSTiNGS survey (DUST in Nearby Galaxies with Spitzer) is a 3.6 and 4.5 $\mu$m imaging survey of 50 nearby dwarf galaxies designed to identify dust-producing asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars and massive stars. Using two epochs, spaced approximately six months apart, we identify a total of 526 dusty variable AGB stars (sometimes called "extreme" or x-AGB stars; [3.6]-[4.5] > 0.1 mag). Of these, 111 are in galaxies with [Fe/H] < -1.5 and 12 are in galaxies with [Fe/H] < -2.0, making them the most metal-poor dust-producing AGB stars known. We compare these identifications to those in the literature and find that most are newly discovered large-amplitude variables, with the exception of $\approx$30 stars in NGC 185 and NGC 147, 1 star in IC 1613, and 1 star in Phoenix. The chemical abundances of the x-AGB variables are unknown, but the low metallicities suggest that they are more likely to be carbon-rich than oxygen-rich and comparisons with existing optical and near-IR photometry confirm that 70 of the x-AGB variables are confirmed or likely carbon stars. We see an increase in the pulsation amplitude with increased dust production, supporting previous studies suggesting that dust production and pulsation are linked. We find no strong evidence linking dust production with metallicity, indicating that dust can form in very metal-poor environments.},

abstract = {After the Big Bang, production of heavy elements in the early Universe takes place starting from the formation of the first stars, their evolution, and explosion. The first supernova explosions have strong dynamical, thermal, and chemical feedback on the formation of subsequent stars and evolution of galaxies. However, the nature of the Universe's first stars and supernova explosions has not been well clarified. The signature of the nucleosynthesis yields of the first stars can be seen in the elemental abundance patterns observed in extremely metal-poor stars. Interestingly, those patterns show some peculiarities relative to the solar abundance pattern, which should provide important clues to understanding the nature of early generations of stars. We thus review the recent results of the nucleosynthesis yields of mainly massive stars for a wide range of stellar masses, metallicities, and explosion energies. We also provide yields tables and examine how those yields are affected by some hydrodynamical effects during supernova explosions, namely, explosion energies from those of hypernovae to faint supernovae, mixing and fallback of processed materials, asphericity, etc. Those parameters in the supernova nucleosynthesis models are constrained from observational data of supernovae and metal-poor stars. Nucleosynthesis yields are then applied to the chemical evolution model of our Galaxy and other types of galaxies to discuss how the chemical enrichment process occurred during evolution.},

abstract = {In this paper we adopt a chemical evolution model, which is an improved version of the Chiappini, Matteucci, {\&} Gratton model, assuming two main accretion episodes for the formation of the Galaxy, the first forming the halo and bulge in a short timescale and the second one forming the thin disk, with a timescale that is an increasing function of the Galactocentric distance (being of the order of 7 Gyrs at the solar neighborhood). The present model takes into account in more detail than previously the halo density distribution and explores the effects of a threshold density in the star formation process during both the halo and disk phases. The model also includes the most recent nucleosynthesis prescriptions concerning supernovae of all types, novae, and single stars dying as white dwarfs. In the comparison between model predictions and available data, we have focused our attention on abundance gradients as well as gas, stellar, and star formation rate distributions along the disk, since this kind of model has already proven to be quite successful in reproducing the solar neighborhood characteristics. We suggest that the mechanism for the formation of the halo leaves detectable imprints on the chemical properties of the outer regions of the disk, whereas the evolution of the halo and the inner disk are almost completely disentangled. This is due to the fact that the halo and disk densities are comparable at large Galactocentric distances and therefore the gas lost from the halo can substantially contribute to building up the outer disk. We also show that the existence of a threshold density for the star formation rate, both in the halo and disk phase, is necessary to reproduce the majority of observational data in the solar vicinity and in the whole disk. In particular, a threshold in the star formation implies the occurrence of a gap in the star formation at the halo-disk transition phase, in agreement with recent data. We conclude that a relatively short halo formation timescale ({\textasciitilde}=0.8 Gyr), in agreement with recent estimates for the age differences among Galactic globular clusters, coupled with an ``inside-out'' formation of the Galactic disk, where the innermost regions are assumed to have formed much faster than the outermost ones, represents, at the moment, the most likely explanation for the formation of the Milky Way. This scenario allows us to predict abundance gradients and other radial properties of the Galactic disk in very good agreement with observations. Moreover, as a consequence of the adopted ``inside-out'' scenario for the disk, we predict that the abundance gradients along the Galactic disk must have increased with time and that the average <[$\alpha$/Fe]> ratios in stars (halo plus disk) slightly decrease going from 4 to 10 kpcs from the Galactic center. We also show that the same ratios increase substantially toward the outermost disk regions and the expected scatter in the stellar ages decreases, because the outermost regions are dominated by halo stars. More observations at large Galactocentric distances are needed to test these predictions.},

abstract = {By comparing the outcome of N-body calculations that include primordial residual-gas expulsion with the observed properties of 20 Galactic globular clusters (GCs) for which the stellar mass function (MF) has been measured, we constrain the time-scale over which the gas of their embedded cluster counterparts must have been removed, the star formation efficiency the progenitor cloud must have had and the strength of the tidal field the clusters must have formed in. The three parameters determine the expansion and mass loss during residual-gas expulsion. After applying corrections for stellar and dynamical evolution, we find birth cluster masses, sizes and densities for the GC sample and the same quantities for the progenitor gas clouds. The pre-cluster cloud-core masses were between 105 and 107Msolar and half-mass radii were typically below 1 pc and reach down to 0.2 pc. We show that the low-mass present day MF (PDMF) slope, initial half-mass radius and initial density of clusters correlate with cluster metallicity, unmasking metallicity as an important parameter driving cluster formation and the gas expulsion process. This work predicts that PD low-concentration clusters should have a higher binary fraction than PD high-concentration clusters. Since the oldest GCs are early residuals from the formation of the Milky Way (MW) and the derived initial conditions probe the environment in which the clusters formed, we use the results as a new tool to study the formation of the inner GC system of the Galaxy. We achieve time-resolved insight into the evolution of the pre-MW gas cloud on short time-scales (a few hundred Myr) via cluster metallicities. The results are shown to be consistent with a contracting and self-gravitating cloud in which fluctuations in the pre-MW potential grow with time. An initially relatively smooth tidal field evolved into a grainy potential within a dynamical time-scale of the collapsing cloud.},

abstract = {Homogeneous abundances of light elements, $\alpha$-elements, and Fe-group elements from high-resolution FLAMES spectra are presented for 76 red giant stars in NGC 6715 (M 54), a massive globular cluster (GC) lying in the nucleus of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy. We also derived detailed abundances for 27 red giants belonging to the Sgr nucleus. Our abundances measure the intrinsic metallicity dispersion ({\textasciitilde}0.19 dex, rms scatter) of M 54, with the bulk of stars peaking at [Fe/H] {\textasciitilde} -1.6 and a long tail extending to higher metallicities, similar to $\omega$ Cen. The spread in these probable nuclear star clusters exceeds those of most GCs: these massive clusters are located in a region intermediate between normal GCs and dwarf galaxies. The GC M 54 exibits a Na-O anticorrelation, a typical signature of GCs, which is instead absent for the Sgr nucleus. The light elements (Mg, Al, Si) participating in the high temperature Mg-Al cycle show that the entire pattern of (anti)correlations produced by proton-capture reactions in H-burning is clearly different between the most metal-rich and most metal-poor components in the two most massive GCs in the Galaxy, confirming early results based on the Na-O anticorrelation. As in $\omega$ Cen, stars affected by most extreme processing, i.e. showing the signature of more massive polluters, are those of the metal-rich component. These observations can be understood if the burst of star formation giving birth to the metal-rich component was delayed by as much as 10-30 Myr with respect to the metal-poor one. The evolution of these massive GCs can be easily reconciled in the general scenario for the formation of GCs sketched previously by ourselves, taking into account that $\omega$ Cen may have already incorporated the surrounding nucleus of its progenitor and lost the remainder of the hosting galaxy while the two are still observable as distinct components in M 54 and the surrounding field.

abstract = {The chemical evolution of the Universe is governed by the chemical yields from stars, which in turn are determined primarily by the initial stellar mass. Even stars as low as 0.9 M⊙ can, at low metallicity, contribute to the chemical evolution of elements. Stars less massive than about 10 M⊙ experience recurrent mixing events that can significantly change the surface composition of the envelope, with observed enrichments in carbon, nitrogen, fluorine, and heavy elements synthesized by the slow neutron capture process (the s-process). Low- and intermediate-mass stars release their nucleosynthesis products through stellar outflows or winds, in contrast to massive stars that explode as core-collapse supernovae. Here we review the stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis for single stars up to {\textasciitilde} 10 M⊙ from the main sequence through to the tip of the asymptotic giant branch (AGB). We include a discussion of the main uncertainties that affect theoretical calculations and review the latest observational data, which are used to constrain uncertain details of the stellar models. We finish with a review of the stellar yields available for stars less massive than about 10 M⊙ and discuss efforts by various groups to address these issues and provide homogeneous yields for low- and intermediate-mass stars covering a broad range of metallicities.},

abstract = {Context. A growing number of solar-like oscillations has been detected in red giant stars thanks to the CoRoT and Kepler space-crafts. In the same way as for main-sequence stars, mode driving is attributed to turbulent convection in the uppermost convective layers of those stars. Aims: The seismic data gathered by CoRoT on red giant stars allow us to test the mode driving theory in physical conditions different from main-sequence stars. Methods: Using a set of 3D hydrodynamical models representative of the upper layers of sub- and red giant stars, we computed the acoustic mode energy supply rate ({p_max}). Assuming adiabatic pulsations and using global stellar models that assume that the surface stratification comes from the 3D hydrodynamical models, we computed the mode amplitude in terms of surface velocity. This was converted into intensity fluctuations using either a simplified adiabatic scaling relation or a non-adiabatic one. Results: From L and M (the luminosity and mass), the energy supply rate {p_max} is found to scale as (L/M)2.6 for both main-sequence and red giant stars, extending previous results. The theoretical amplitudes in velocity under-estimate the Doppler velocity measurements obtained so far from the ground for red giant stars by about 30%. In terms of intensity, the theoretical scaling law based on the adiabatic intensity-velocity scaling relation results in an under-estimation by a factor of about 2.5 with respect to the CoRoT seismic measurements. On the other hand, using the non-adiabatic intensity-velocity relation significantly reduces the discrepancy with the CoRoT data. The theoretical amplitudes remain 40% below, however, the CoRoT measurements. Conclusions: Our results show that scaling relations of mode amplitudes cannot be simply extended from main-sequence to red giant stars in terms of intensity on the basis of adiabatic relations because non-adiabatic effects for red giant stars are important and cannot be neglected. We discuss possible reasons for the remaining differences.},

abstract = {Having shown in a recent paper that the main sequence of $\omega$ Centauri is split into two distinct branches, we now present spectroscopic results showing that the bluer sequence is less metal-poor. We have carefully combined VLT's GIRAFFE spectra of 17 stars on each side of the split into a single spectrum for each branch, with adequate signal-to-noise ratio, to show clearly that the stars of the blue main sequence are less metal-poor by 0.3 dex than those of the dominant red one. From an analysis of the individual spectra, we could not detect any abundance spread among the blue main-sequence stars, whereas the red main-sequence stars show a 0.2 dex spread in metallicity. We use stellar structure models to show that only greatly enhanced helium can explain the color difference between the two main sequences, and we discuss ways in which this enhancement could have arisen.

Primordial nucleosynthesis provides a unique opportunity to test the assumptions of the 'standard' model. The present review provides a summary of the predictions of the standard model, taking into account also a critical evaluation of the implications of the current observational data. The standard hot big bang model is discussed, taking into account the epoch of nucleosynthesis, the primordial abundances, uncertainties in the predicted abundances, and possible variations on the theme of the standard model. The observed abundances are considered, giving attention to destruction and production during galactic evolution, deuterium, He-3, He-4, lithium, and an abundance summary. Predicted and observed abundances are compared, and cosmological constraints are examined.},

abstract = {We present a self-consistent model for stellar turbulent convection that is similar in spirit to the CM model (Canuto {\&} Mazzitelli 1991) since it accounts for the full spectrum of the turbulent eddies rather than only one eddy, as done in the mixing length theory (MLT). The model differs from the CM model in the treatment of the rate of energy input nS(k) from the source that generates the turbulence. In the present model, nS(k) is controlled by both the source and the turbulence it ultimately generates, thus ensuring a self-consistent modeling of the turbulence. This improves the CM model in which nS(k) was taken to be equal to the growth rate of the linear unstable convective modes. However, since the formulation of a self-consistent treatment is far from simple, we were forced to use a representation of the nonlinear interactions less complete than the one in the CM model. The ensuing equations were solved numerically for a wide range of convective efficiencies. The results are the convective flux, the mean square turbulent velocity, the root mean squared turbulent pressure and the turbulent viscosity. We implemented the model in the ATON stellar structure code and computed the evolution of a solar model. The results are generally similar to those of the CM model and thus quite different from the MLT. The present model requires a smaller overshoot into the upper radiative zone than does the CM model, in accord with recent empirical estimates. Application to Population II stars and comparison with the very metal-poor globular cluster M68 yields an age in the range 11-12 Gyr. This is somewhat younger than the CM age, which in turn is younger than the corresponding MLT age, a result of possible cosmological interest},

These models are based on extensive stellar evolution calculations for initial masses between 1 and 7Msun_ which have been carried out all the way from the main sequence through the AGB towards the stage of white dwarfs. Concerning mass losses during the post-AGB evolution we smoothly reduced the high AGB mass-loss rates and then applied rates adapted from the radiation driven wind theory. The transition time from the AGB to the central-star region depends strongly on the treatment of mass-loss beyond the AGB. Furthermore, our calculations indicate that massive central stars can fade much more slowly than hitherto assumed. It is shown that the fading time scales and the AGB history are closely connected, and that therefore the preceding mass loss on the AGB plays an important role for the post-AGB evolution.},

abstract = {We calculate the evolution of heavy-element abundances from C to Zn in the solar neighborhood, adopting our new nucleosynthesis yields. Our yields are calculated for wide ranges of metallicity (Z=0-Zsolar) and the explosion energy (normal supernovae and hypernovae), based on the light-curve and spectra fitting of individual supernovae. The elemental abundance ratios are in good agreement with observations. Among the $\alpha$-elements, O, Mg, Si, S, and Ca show a plateau at [Fe/H]<{\textasciitilde}-1, while Ti is underabundant overall. The observed abundance of Zn ([Zn/Fe]{\textasciitilde}0) can be explained only by the high-energy explosion models, as it requires a large contribution of hypernovae. The observed decrease in the odd-Z elements (Na, Al, and Cu) toward low [Fe/H] is reproduced by the metallicity effect on nucleosynthesis. The iron-peak elements (Cr, Mn, Co, and Ni) are consistent with the observed mean values at -2.5<{\textasciitilde}[Fe/H]<{\textasciitilde}-1, and the observed trend at the lower metallicity can be explained by the energy effect. We also show the abundance ratios and the metallicity distribution functions of the Galactic bulge, halo, and thick disk. Our results suggest that the formation timescale of the thick disk is {\textasciitilde}1-3 Gyr.},

These observations provide an unprecedented, precise, and homogeneous data-set of Fe abundances in GCs. We use it to study the cosmic scatter of iron and find that, as far as Fe is concerned, most GCs can still be considered mono-metallic, since the upper limit to the scatter of iron is less than 0.05 dex, meaning that the degree of homogeneity is better than 12%. The scatter in Fe we find seems to have a dependence on luminosity, possibly due to the well-known inadequacies of stellar atmospheres for upper-RGB stars and/or to intrinsic variability. It also seems to be correlated with cluster properties, like the mass, indicating a larger scatter in more massive GCs which is likely a (small) true intrinsic scatter. The 19 GCs, covering the metallicity range of the bulk of Galactic GCs, define an accurate and updated metallicity scale. We provide transformation equations for a few existing scales. We also provide new values of [Fe/H], on our scale, for all GCs in the Harris catalogue. Based on observations collected at ESO telescopes under programmes 072.D-507 and 073.D-0211.},

The Information Age has ushered in a number of new mineral uses in a number of products including cell phones (e.g., tantalum) and liquid crystal displays (e.g., indium). For some minerals, such as the platinum group metals used to make cataytic converters in cars, there is no substitute. If the supply of any given mineral were to become restricted, consumers and sectors of the U.S. economy could be significantly affected. Risks to minerals supplies can include a sudden increase in demand or the possibility that natural ores can be exhausted or become too difficult to extract. Minerals are more vulnerable to supply restrictions if they come from a limited number of mines, mining companies, or nations. Baseline information on minerals is currently collected at the federal level, but no established methodology has existed to identify potentially critical minerals. This book develops such a methodology and suggests an enhanced federal initiative to collect and analyze the additional data needed to support this type of tool. },

We find a yield of 3.1 {\texttimes} 10-4Msolar of 19F with our recommended rate, and a difference of a factor of 2 between the yields computed with the upper and lower limits. In comparison with previous work we find a difference in the yield of a factor of approximately 4, connected with a different choice of mass loss.

abstract = {The solar chemical composition is an important ingredient in our understanding of the formation, structure, and evolution of both the Sun and our Solar System. Furthermore, it is an essential reference standard against which the elemental contents of other astronomical objects are compared. In this review, we evaluate the current understanding of the solar photospheric composition. In particular, we present a redetermination of the abundances of nearly all available elements, using a realistic new three-dimensional (3D), time-dependent hydrodynamical model of the solar atmosphere. We have carefully considered the atomic input data and selection of spectral lines, and accounted for departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) whenever possible. The end result is a comprehensive and homogeneous compilation of the solar elemental abundances. Particularly noteworthy findings are significantly lower abundances of C, N, O, and Ne compared to the widely used values of a decade ago. The new solar chemical composition is supported by a high degree of internal consistency between available abundance indicators, and by agreement with values obtained in the Solar Neighborhood and from the most pristine meteorites. There is, however, a stark conflict with standard models of the solar interior according to helioseismology, a discrepancy that has yet to find a satisfactory resolution.},

abstract = {Context. A recent survey of a large sample of Galactic intermediate-mass (>3 M{\&}sun;) asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars shows that they exhibit large overabundances of rubidium (Rb) up to 100-1000 times solar. In contrast, zirconium (Zr) is not enriched in these stars compared to its solar abundances. These observations set constraints on our theoretical notion of the slow neutron capture process (s process) that occurs inside intermediate-mass AGB stars. Lithium (Li) abundances are also reported for these stars. In intermediate-mass AGB stars, Li can be produced by proton captures occuring at the base of the convective envelope. For this reason the observations of Rb, Zr, and Li set complementary constraints on different processes occurring in the same stars. Aims: We present predictions for the abundances of Rb, Zr, and Li as computed for the first time simultaneously in intermediate-mass AGB star models and compare them to the current observational constraints. Methods: We calculate the Rb, Zr, and Li surface abundances for stellar models with masses between 3 and 6.5 M{\&}sun; and metallicities between 0.02 and 0.004. Results: We find that the Rb abundance increases with increasing stellar mass, as is inferred from observations but we are unable to match the highest observed [Rb/Fe] abundances. Variations of the reaction rates of the neutron-capture cross sections involved with Rb production and the rate of the 22Ne($\alpha$,n)25Mg reaction, responsible for neutron production inside these stars, yield only modest variations in the surface Rb content of $\approx$0.3 dex. Inclusion of a partial mixing zone (PMZ) to activate the 13C($\alpha$,n)16O reaction as an additional neutron source yields significant enhancements in the Rb abundance. However this leads to Zr abundances that exceed the upper limits of the current observational constraints. If the third dredge-up (TDU) efficiency remains as high during the final stages of AGB evolution as during the earlier stages, we can match the lowest values of the observed Rb abundance range. We predict large variations in the Li abundance, which are observed. Finally, the predicted Rb production increases with decreasing metallicity, in qualitative agreement with observations of Magellanic Cloud AGB stars. However stellar models of Z = 0.008 and Z = 0.004 intermediate-mass AGB stars do not produce enough Rb to match the observed abundances.},

abstract = {Recent progress in studies of globular clusters has shown that they are not simple stellar populations, but rather are made up of multiple generations. Evidence stems both from photometry and spectroscopy. A new paradigm is arising for the formation of massive star clusters, which includes several episodes of star formation. While this provides an explanation for several features of globular clusters, including the second-parameter problem, it also opens new perspectives on the relation between globular clusters and the halo of our Galaxy, and by extension on all populations with a high specific frequency of globular clusters, such as, e.g., giant elliptical galaxies. We review progress in this area, focussing on the most recent studies. Several points remain to become properly understood, in particular those concerning the nature of the polluters producing the abundance pattern in the clusters and the typical timescale, the range of cluster masses where this phenomenon is active, and the relation between globular clusters and other satellites of our Galaxy.},

The clusters are of similar metallicity ([Fe/H]{\textasciitilde}=-1.2), but M4 is decidedly s-process enriched relative to M5: [Ba/Fe]=+0.6 for M4 but 0.0 for M5. The Rb and Pb abundances were derived by comparing synthetic spectra with high-resolution, high signal-to-noise ratio spectra obtained with MIKE on the Magellan Telescope. Abundances of Y, Zr, La, and Eu were also obtained. In M4, the mean abundances from 12 giants are [Rb/Fe]=0.39+/-0.02 ($\sigma$=0.07), [Rb/Zr]=0.17+/-0.03 ($\sigma$=0.08), and [Pb/Fe]=0.30+/-0.02 ($\sigma$=0.07). In M5, the mean abundances from two giants are [Rb/Fe]=0.00+/-0.05 ($\sigma$=0.06), [Rb/Zr]=0.08+/-0.08 ($\sigma$=0.11), and [Pb/Fe]=-0.35+/-0.02 ($\sigma$=0.04). Within the measurement uncertainties, the abundance ratios [Rb/Fe], [Pb/Fe], and [Rb/X] for X = Y, Zr, and La are constant from star to star in each cluster, and none of these ratios are correlated with O or Na abundances. While M4 has a higher Rb abundance than M5, the ratios [Rb/X] are similar in both clusters, indicating that the nature of the s-products is very similar for each cluster but the gas from which M4's stars formed had a higher concentration of these products.

abstract = {The bulk of p isotopes is created in the "gamma processes" mainly by sequences of photodisintegrations and beta decays in explosive conditions in Type Ia supernovae (SNIa) or in core collapse supernovae (ccSN). The contribution of different stellar sources to the observed distribution of p-nuclei in the solar system is still under debate. We explore single degenerate Type Ia supernovae in the framework of two-dimensional SNIa delayed-detonation explosion models. Travaglio et al. discussed the sensitivity of p-nuclei production to different SNIa models, i.e., delayed detonations of different strength, deflagrations, and the dependence on selected s-process seed distributions. Here we present a detailed study of p-process nucleosynthesis occurring in SNIa with s-process seeds at different metallicities. Based on the delayed-detonation model DDT-a of TRV11, we analyze the dependence of p-nucleosynthesis on the s-seed distribution obtained from different strengths of the 13C pocket. We also demonstrate that 208Pb seed alone changes the p-nuclei production considerably. The heavy-s seeds (140 <=A < 208) contribute with about 30%-40% to the total light-p nuclei production up to 132Ba (with the exception of 94Mo and 130Ba, to which the heavy-s seeds contribute with about 15% only). Using a Galactic chemical evolution code from Travaglio et al., we study the contribution of SNIa to the solar stable p-nuclei. We find that explosions of Chandrasekhar-mass single degenerate systems produce a large amount of p-nuclei in our Galaxy, both in the range of light (A <= 120) and heavy p-nuclei, at almost flat average production factors (within a factor of about three). We discussed in details p-isotopes such as 94Mo with a behavior diverging from the average, which we attribute to uncertainties in the nuclear data or in SNIa modeling. Li et al. find that about 70% of all SNeIa are normal events. If these are explained in the framework of explosions of Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarfs resulting from the single-degenerate progenitor channel, we find that they are responsible for at least 50% of the p-nuclei abundances in the solar system.},

This is roughly the same mass fraction as contained in the nuclear star cluster (or stellar nucleus) present in most nearby low-mass galaxies. Motivated by this ``coincidence,'' this Letter discusses a scenario in which globular clusters of present-day galaxies are the surviving nuclei of the dwarf galaxies that-according to the hierarchical merging paradigm of galaxy formation-constitute the ``building blocks'' of present-day massive galaxies. This scenario, which was first suggested by Freeman, has become more attractive recently in light of studies that demonstrate a complex star formation history in a number of massive globular clusters.},

abstract = {We present abundances of Fe, Na, and O for 1409 red giant stars in 15 galactic globular clusters (GCs), derived from the homogeneous analysis of high-resolution FLAMES/GIRAFFE spectra. Combining the present data with results from our FLAMES/UVES spectra and from previous studies within the project, we obtained a total sample of 1958 stars in 19 clusters, the largest and most homogeneous database of this kind to date. The programme clusters cover a range in metallicity from [Fe/H] = -2.4 dex to [Fe/H] = -0.4 dex, with a wide variety of global parameters (morphology of the horizontal branch, mass, concentration, etc.). For all clusters we find the Na-O anticorrelation, the classical signature of the operation of proton-capture reactions in H-burning at high temperature in a previous generation of more massive stars that are now extinct. Using quantitative criteria (from the morphology and extension of the Na-O anticorrelation), we can define three different components of the stellar population in GCs. We separate a primordial component (P) of first-generation stars, and two components of second-generation stars, that we name intermediate (I) and extreme (E) populations from their different chemical composition. The P component is present in all clusters, and its fraction is almost constant at about one third. The I component represents the bulk of the cluster population. On the other hand, E component is not present in all clusters, and it is more conspicuous in some (but not in all) of the most massive clusters. We discuss the fractions and spatial distributions of these components in our sample and in two additional clusters (M 3 = NGC 5272 and M 13 = NGC6205) with large sets of stars analysed in the literature. We also find that the slope of the anti-correlation (defined by the minimum O and maximum Na abundances) changes from cluster-to-cluster, a change that is represented well by a bilinear relation on cluster metallicity and luminosity. This second dependence suggests a correlation between average mass of polluters and cluster mass. Based on observations collected at ESO telescopes under programmes 072.D-507 and 073.D-0211.

These spectra have been analyzed to determine the abundances of several neutron-capture elements, including the radioactive chronometer element thorium. There are two principal results of this study. First, the abundances of the heavier (Z>=56) elements for each of the three stars is well matched by a scaled solar system r-process abundance distribution. Second, a weighted mean-observed Th/Eu ratio for the stars implies an age for the neutron-capture material in M15 stars of 14+/-3 Gyr, in reasonable agreement with other recent age estimates for Galactic globular clusters.

Current models are in agreement with the helioseismic inferences, which suggests, for example, that the disagreement between the predicted and observed fluxes of neutrinos from the sun is not caused by errors in the models. However, the GONG data reveal subtle errors in the models, such as an excess in sound speed just beneath the convection zone. These discrepancies indicate effects that have so far not been correctly accounted for; for example, it is plausible that the sound-speed differences reflect weak mixing in stellar interiors, of potential importance to the overall evolution of stars and ultimately to estimates of the age of the galaxy based on stellar evolution calculations.},

We introduce a new `observer-friendly' function, the transition discriminant Dtrans, which provides empirical constraints as well as a powerful comparison between the currently available data of metal-poor halo stars and theoretical predictions of the formation of the first low-mass stars (<{\textasciitilde} 1Msolar). Specifically, we compare the empirical stellar results with the theory that fine-structure lines of C and O dominate the transition from Population III to Population II in the early Universe. We find the currently available data for halo stars as well as for dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies and globular clusters to be consistent with this theory. An explanation for the observed lack of metal-poor stars in dSph galaxies and globular clusters is also suggested. Finally, we predict that any star to be found with [Fe/H] <{\textasciitilde} -4 should have enhanced C and/or O abundances. The high C and O abundances of the two most iron-poor stars are in line with our prediction.},

The models cover an initial mass range from 1 M {\&}{\#}9737; to 7 M {\&}{\#}9737;. Final surface abundances and stellar yields are calculated for all elements from hydrogen to bismuth as well as isotopes up to the iron group. We present the first study of neutron-capture nucleosynthesis in intermediate-mass AGB models, including a super-AGB model, of [Fe/H] = {\textendash}1.2. We examine in detail a low-mass AGB model of 2 M {\&}{\#}9737; where the 13C($\alpha$,n)16O reaction is the main source of neutrons. We also examine an intermediate-mass AGB model of 5 M {\&}{\#}9737; where intershell temperatures are high enough to activate the 22Ne neutron source, which produces high neutron densities up to {\textasciitilde}1014 n cm{\textendash}3. Hot bottom burning is activated in models with M >= 3 M {\&}{\#}9737;. With the 3 M {\&}{\#}9737; model, we investigate the effect of varying the extent in mass of the region where protons are mixed from the envelope into the intershell at the deepest extent of each third dredge-up. We compare the results of the low-mass models to three post-AGB stars with a metallicity of [Fe/H] {\textasciitilde}= {\textendash} 1.2. The composition is a good match to the predicted neutron-capture abundances except for Pb and we confirm that the observed Pb abundances are lower than what is calculated by AGB models.},

It is found that a large part of the nuclear flow in the r-process may be carried by charged particle reactions up to about A of about 100. It is speculated that the site of these processes is the high-entropy 'wind' of a young neutron star in which neutrino energy deposition is driving mass loss. The pass of r-process ejected per supernova is expected to be about 0.0001 solar mass per Type II or Ib supernova, but this is sensitive to details of the presupernova structure, the explosion mechanism, and the amount of material that falls back onto the neutron star when the reverse shock arrives there.},

For Ne-22Ne(alpha, n)Mg-25 the new data cover the energy range from threshold up to 2300 keV. From these experiments some of the parameters of the Ne-22(alpha, n)Mg-25 resonances have been determined using unfolding techniques. A resonance at about 620 keV could clearly be ascribed to the background reaction B-11(alpha, n)N-l4. The excitation function of C-13(alpha, n)O-16 has been measured over the energy range 350-1400 keV, where the cross section varies over eight orders of magnitude. The S-factor of this reaction indicates an increase toward lower energies. On the basis of the experimental data the reaction rates at helium-burning temperatures were determined for these two reactions: both rates are increased compared with previous evaluations.},

abstract = {Aims:We analyse the effects of a first generation of fast rotating massive stars on the dynamical and chemical properties of globular clusters. Methods: We use stellar models of fast rotating massive stars, losing mass through a slow mechanical equatorial winds to produce material rich in H-burning products. We propose that stars with high Na and low O abundances (hereafter anomalous stars) are formed from matter made of slow winds of individual massive stars and of interstellar matter. The proportion of slow wind and of interstellar material is fixed in order to reproduce the observed Li-Na anticorrelation in NGC 6752. Results: In the case that globular clusters, during their lifetime, did not lose any stars, we found that to reproduce the observed ratio of normal to anomalous stars, a flat initial mass function (IMF) is needed, with typically a slope x=0.55 (a Salpeter's IMF has x=1.35). In the case that globular clusters suffer from an evaporation of normal stars, the IMF slope can be steeper: to have x=1.35, about 96% of the normal stars would be lost. We make predictions for the distribution of stars as a function of their [O/Na] and obtain quite reasonable agreement with that one observed for NGC 6752. Predictions for the number fraction of stars with different values of helium, of the 12C/13C and 16O/17O ratios are discussed, as well as the expected relations between values of [O/Na] and those of helium, of [C/N], of 12C/13C and of 16O/17O. Future observations might test these predictions. We also provide predictions for the present day mass of the clusters expressed in units of mass of the gas used to form stars, and for the way the present day mass is distributed between the first and second generation of stars and the stellar remnants.},

We used a new technique which measures fluctuations in the temperature of the star via their effect on the equivalent widths of the Balmer lines. The observations were obtained over six nights with the 2.5 m Nordic Optical Telescope on La Palma and consist of 12 684 low-dispersion spectra. In the power spectrum of the equivalent-width measurements, we find an excess of power at frequencies aroun 850 microHz (period 20 min) which consist of a regular series of peaks with a spacing of Delta nu = 40.3 micro Hz. We identify 13 oscillation modes, with frequency separations in agreement with theoretical expectations. Similar observations of the daytime sky show the 5 min solar oscillations at the expected frequencies.},

The position of the main-sequence turnoff is found to be at V_TO=17(m.0) +/- 0(m.1) , (B-V)=0.863+/-0.007, (V-I)=1.224+/-0.010, (B-I)= 2.084+/-0.010. Our turnoff point is redder and fainter than those found for M 4 in the majority of recent studies, probably because of our field being located in the western, most reddened part of the cluster. The spread of stars around the main-sequence locus has an unusual shape (broadening near the turnoff point and close to the photometric limit), earlier noticed by \cite{rea95} and attributed by them to photometric effects. We have analyzed the possible reasons for this effect and concluded that, at least in our case, it is most probably due to differential absorption. We confirm the deviation of theoretical isochrones from the fainter parts of the M 4 main-sequence locus found by \cite{aea88}. Several curious structural details (a depression and an excess of stars) have been revealed in the brighter parts of the main-sequence luminosity function of M 4.},

The observations consist of two fields: the primary science field, a single Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) pointing centered approximately 5' from the cluster center; and the parallel field, a single WFPC2 field centered on the cluster center. Using the exquisite photometric precision of these observations, we determine the binary fraction in these regions of the cluster by examining stars lying off the main sequence. The binary fraction is constrained to be 0.012 {\textpm} 0.004 in the ACS field, and to be 0.051 {\textpm} 0.010 in the WFPC field. N-body simulations by Hurley et al. in 2007 suggest that the binary fraction remains nearly constant beyond the half-mass radius for the lifetime of the cluster. In the context of these simulations, our results suggest that NGC 6397 had a primordial binary fraction of only {\textasciitilde}1%.

abstract = {Globular clusters (GCs), once thought to be well approximated as simple stellar populations (i.e. all stars having the same age and chemical abundance), are now known to host a variety of anomalies, such as multiple discrete (or spreads in) populations in colour-magnitude diagrams and abundance variations in light elements (e.g. Na, O, Al). Multiple models have been put forward to explain the observed anomalies, although all have serious shortcomings (e.g. requiring a non-standard initial mass function of stars and GCs to have been initially 10-100 times more massive than observed today). These models also do not agree with observations of massive stellar clusters forming today, which do not display significant age spreads nor have gas/dust within the cluster. Here we present a model for the formation of GCs, where low-mass pre-main-sequence stars accrete enriched material released from interacting massive binary and rapidly rotating stars on to their circumstellar discs, and ultimately on to the young stars. As was shown in previous studies, the accreted material matches the unusual abundances and patterns observed in GCs. The proposed model does not require multiple generations of star formation, conforms to the known properties of massive clusters forming today and solves the `mass budget problem' without requiring GCs to have been significantly more massive at birth. Potential caveats to the model as well as model predictions are discussed.},

abstract = {All globular clusters (GCs) studied to date show evidence for internal (star-to-star) variation in their light-element abundances (including Li, C, N, O, F, Na, Mg, Al, and probably He). These variations have been interpreted as evidence for multiple star formation episodes within GCs, with secondary episodes fueled, at least in part, by the ejecta of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars from a first generation of stars. A major puzzle emerging from this otherwise plausible scenario is that the fraction of stars associated with the second episode of star formation is observed to be much larger than expected for a standard initial mass function. The present work investigates this tension by modeling the observed anti-correlation between [Na/Fe] and [O/Fe] for 20 Galactic GCs. If the abundance pattern of the retained AGB ejecta does not depend on GC mass at fixed [Fe/H], then a strong correlation is found between the fraction of current GC stellar mass composed of pure AGB ejecta, fp , and GC mass. This fraction varies from 0.20 at low masses (104.5 M ⊙) to 0.45 at high masses (106.5 M ⊙). The fraction of mass associated with pure AGB ejecta is directly related to the total mass of the cluster at birth; the ratio between the initial and present mass in stars can therefore be derived. Assuming a star formation efficiency of 50%, the observed Na-O anti-correlations imply that GCs were at least 10-20 times more massive at birth, a conclusion that is in qualitative agreement with previous work. These factors are lower limits because any mass-loss mechanism that removes first- and second-generation stars equally will leave fp unchanged. The mass dependence of fp probably arises because lower mass GCs are unable to retain all of the AGB ejecta from the first stellar generation. Recent observations of elemental abundances in intermediate-age Large Magellanic Cloud clusters are re-interpreted and shown to be consistent with this basic scenario. The small scatter in fp at fixed GC mass argues strongly that the process responsible for the large mass loss is internal to GCs. A satisfactory explanation of these trends is currently lacking.},

abstract = {Fully evolutionary models have been built to follow the phases of asymptotic giant branch evolution with mass loss for metal mass fractions from Z=2{\texttimes}10-4 to Z=4{\texttimes}10-3. The hot bottom burning at the base of the convective envelope is followed by fully coupled nuclear burning and noninstantaneous mixing. The models also show the occurrence of a spontaneous (i.e., not induced by overshooting) third dredge-up. For the first time, we find that temperatures close to or even larger than 108 K are achieved at low Z; the full CNO cycle operates at the base of the envelope, the 16O abundance for the most metal-poor models of 4 and 5 Msolar is drastically reduced, and sodium and aluminum production by proton capture on neon and magnesium can occur. Lithium is first largely produced in the envelope and then burned completely, so the average lithium abundance in the expelled envelope is a factor of up to 5 times smaller than the initial one, but it is never completely depleted. These results may be relevant for the evolution of primordial massive globular clusters; we suggest that the low-mass stars may have been polluted at the surface by accretion from the gas that was lost from the evolving intermediate-mass stars at early ages [(1-2){\texttimes}108 yr]. In this hypothesis, we should expect that the polluted stars show smaller abundances of oxygen, larger abundances of products of advanced nucleosynthesis (as Na and Al), and lower, but never negligible, abundances of lithium. The abundance spreads should be smaller in clusters of higher metallicities, where the lithium in the polluted stars could be larger than in the nonpolluted stars.},

abstract = {Data from the literature are used to explore the relation between $\lambda$3883 CN band strength and the sodium and oxygen abundances of red giants in the globular cluster Messier 5. Although there is a broad tendency for CN-strong giants in this cluster to have higher sodium abundances and lower oxygen abundances than CN-weak giants of comparable absolute magnitude there are some secondary features in these relations. The oxygen abundance [O/Fe] shows a greater range (0.6--0.7 dex) among the CN-strong giants than the CN-weak giants ($\approx$0.3 dex). By contrast, [Na/Fe] shows a 0.6--0.7 dex range among the CN-weak giants, but a more limited range of 0.3--0.4 dex among the CN-strong giants. The $\lambda$3883 CN band anticorrelates in strength with [O/Fe] among the CN-strong giants, but there is little, if any, such trend among the CN-weak giants. In contrast, the CN band strength may show a modest correlation with [Na/Fe] among the CN-weak giants, but there is little evidence for such among the CN-strong giants. Neither oxygen or sodium abundance defines a continuous relation with CN band strength. Instead, the CN-strong and CN-weak giants overlap in their sodium and possibly their oxygen abundances. At oxygen abundances of [O/Fe] = 0.20 {\textpm} 0.05 it is possible to have both CN-weak and CN-strong giants, although there may be a discontinuity in [O/Fe] between these two groups of stars that has been smeared out by observational errors. Both CN-weak and CN-strong giants populate the sodium abundance range 0.4 $\le$ [Na/Fe] $\le$ 0.6. Messier 5 may be displaying the results of spatially heterogeneous chemical self-enrichment.},

abstract = {Context. Gravity waves (or their signatures) are detected in stars thanks to helio- and asteroseismology, and they may play an important role in the evolution of stellar angular momentum. Moreover, a previous observational study of the CoRoT target HD 51452 demonstrated the potential strong impact of rotation on the stochastic excitation of gravito-inertial waves in stellar interiors. Aims: Our goal is to explore and unravel the action of rotation on the stochastic excitation of gravity and gravito-inertial waves in stars. Methods: The dynamics of gravito-inertial waves in stellar interiors in both radiation and in convection zones is described with a local non-traditional f-plane model. The coupling of these waves with convective turbulent flows, which leads to their stochastic excitation, is studied in this framework. Results: First, we find that in the super-inertial regime in which the wave frequency is twice as high as the rotation frequency ($\sigma$ > 2$\Omega$), the evanescence of gravito-inertial waves in convective regions decreases with decreasing wave frequency. Next, in the sub-inertial regime ($\sigma$ < 2$\Omega$), gravito-inertial waves become purely propagative inertial waves in convection zones. Simultaneously, turbulence in convective regions is modified by rotation. Indeed, the turbulent energy cascade towards small scales is slowed down, and in the case of rapid rotation, strongly anisotropic turbulent flows are obtained that can be understood as complex non-linear triadic interactions of propagative inertial waves. These different behaviours, due to the action of the Coriolis acceleration, strongly modify the wave coupling with turbulent flows. On one hand, turbulence weakly influenced by rotation is coupled with evanescent gravito-inertial waves. On the other hand, rapidly rotating turbulence is intrinsically and strongly coupled with sub-inertial waves. Finally, to study these mechanisms, the traditional approximation cannot be assumed because it does not properly treat the coupling between gravity and inertial waves in the sub-inertial regime. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate the action of rotation on stochastic excitation of gravity waves thanks to the Coriolis acceleration, which modifies their dynamics in rapidly rotating stars and turbulent flows. As the ratio 2$\Omega$/$\sigma$ increases, the couplings and thus the amplitude of stochastic gravity waves are amplified.},

abstract = {We present spectral and photometric observations of 10 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) in the redshift range 0.16 <= z <= 0.62. The luminosity distances of these objects are determined by methods that employ relations between SN Ia luminosity and light curve shape. Combined with previous data from our High-z Supernova Search Team and recent results by Riess et al., this expanded set of 16 high-redshift supernovae and a set of 34 nearby supernovae are used to place constraints on the following cosmological parameters: the Hubble constant (H_0), the mass density (Omega_M), the cosmological constant (i.e., the vacuum energy density, Omega_Lambda), the deceleration parameter (q_0), and the dynamical age of the universe (t_0). The distances of the high-redshift SNe Ia are, on average, 10%-15% farther than expected in a low mass density (Omega_M = 0.2) universe without a cosmological constant. Different light curve fitting methods, SN Ia subsamples, and prior constraints unanimously favor eternally expanding models with positive cosmological constant (i.e., Omega_Lambda > 0) and a current acceleration of the expansion (i.e., q_0 < 0). With no prior constraint on mass density other than Omega_M >= 0, the spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia are statistically consistent with q_0 < 0 at the 2.8 sigma and 3.9 sigma confidence levels, and with Omega_Lambda > 0 at the 3.0 sigma and 4.0 sigma confidence levels, for two different fitting methods, respectively. Fixing a ``minimal'' mass density, Omega_M = 0.2, results in the weakest detection, Omega_Lambda > 0 at the 3.0 sigma confidence level from one of the two methods. For a flat universe prior (Omega_M + Omega_Lambda = 1), the spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia require Omega_Lambda > 0 at 7 sigma and 9 sigma formal statistical significance for the two different fitting methods. A universe closed by ordinary matter (i.e., Omega_M = 1) is formally ruled out at the 7 sigma to 8 sigma confidence level for the two different fitting methods. We estimate the dynamical age of the universe to be 14.2 +/- 1.7 Gyr including systematic uncertainties in the current Cepheid distance scale. We estimate the likely effect of several sources of systematic error, including progenitor and metallicity evolution, extinction, sample selection bias, local perturbations in the expansion rate, gravitational lensing, and sample contamination. Presently, none of these effects appear to reconcile the data with Omega_Lambda = 0 and q_0 >= 0.},

abstract = {Aims: We study the star-formation history of the Galactic bulge, as derived from the age distribution of the central stars of planetary nebulae that belong to this stellar population. Methods: The high resolution imaging and spectroscopic observations of 31 compact planetary nebulae are used to derive their central star masses. We use the Bl{\"o}cker post asymptotic giant branch (post-AGB) evolutionary models, which are accelerated by a factor of three in this case to better fit the white dwarf mass distribution and asteroseismological masses. Initial-final mass relations (IFMR) are derived using white dwarfs in clusters. These are applied to determine original stellar masses and ages. The age distribution is corrected for observational bias as a function of stellar mass. We predict that there are about 2000 planetary nebulae in the bulge. Results: The planetary nebula population points at a young bulge population with an extended star-formation history. The Bl{\"o}cker tracks with the cluster IFMR result in ages, which are unexpectedly young. We find that the Bl{\"o}cker post-AGB tracks need to be accelerated by a factor of three to fit the local white dwarf masses. This acceleration extends the age distribution. We adjust the IFMR as a free parameter to map the central star ages on the full age range of bulge stellar populations. This fit requires a steeper IFMR than the cluster relation. We find a star-formation rate in the Galactic bulge, which is approximately constant between 3 and 10 Gyr ago. The result indicates that planetary nebulae are mainly associated with the younger and more metal-rich bulge populations. Conclusions: The constant rate of star-formation between 3 and 10 Gyr agrees with suggestions that the metal-rich component of the bulge is formed during an extended process, such as a bar interaction.

abstract = {We use Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and ground-based imaging to study the multiple populations of 47 Tucanae (47 Tuc), combining high-precision photometry with calculations of synthetic spectra. Using filters covering a wide range of wavelengths, our HST photometry splits the main sequence into two branches, and we find that this duality is repeated in the subgiant and red giant regions, and on the horizontal branch. We calculate theoretical stellar atmospheres for main-sequence stars, assuming different chemical composition mixtures, and we compare their predicted colors through the HST filters with our observed colors. We find that we can match the complex of observed colors with a pair of populations, one with primeval abundance and another with enhanced nitrogen and a small helium enhancement, but with depleted C and O. We confirm that models of red giant and red horizontal branch stars with that pair of compositions also give colors that fit our observations. We suggest that the different strengths of molecular bands of OH, CN, CH, and NH, falling in different photometric bands, are responsible for the color splits of the two populations. Near the cluster center, in each portion of the color-magnitude diagram the population with primeval abundances makes up only {\textasciitilde}20% of the stars, a fraction that increases outward, approaching equality in the outskirts of the cluster, with a fraction {\textasciitilde}30% averaged over the whole cluster. Thus the second, He/N-enriched population is more concentrated and contributes the majority of the present-day stellar content of the cluster. We present evidence that the color-magnitude diagram of 47 Tuc consists of intertwined sequences of the two populations, whose separate identities can be followed continuously from the main sequence up to the red giant branch, and thence to the horizontal branch. A third population is visible only in the subgiant branch, where it includes {\textasciitilde}8% of the stars.

abstract = {A detailed abundance analysis has been performed using high-dispersion echelle spectra for three members of M22 and five giants in Omega Cen. The three stars in M22 are chemically identical, except for sodium, and less definitely, for barium. There is a range of 0.8 dex in the derived Na abundance of these stars, far larger than that allowed by the errors. The Omega Cen giants show that a range of chemical composition exists for all elements in this unique cluster. However, as one compares metal-poor with metal-rich stars in Omega Cen, each element is not enhanced by a constant factor. In the more metal-rich Omega Cen giants, the light elements Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, and Sc are all enhanced by a factor of 1.8; Ba and the rare earths are enhanced by a factor of 10. Furthermore, the two most metal-rich Omega Cen stars studied have vastly different Na, Mg, Al, and Sc abundances.},

abstract = {We present the abundance analysis of stars from the tip of the red giant branch (RGB) to below the RGB bump in the globular cluster NGC 2808 based on high-resolution echelle spectra. We derive abundances of Al, $\alpha$-process elements (Si I, Ca I, Ti I, and Ti II), and Fe-group elements (Sc II, V I, Cr I, Cr II, Mn I, Co I, and Ni I). Apart from Mg being somewhat reduced, likely because it has been depleted at the expense of Al in the MgAl cycle, the other $\alpha$-element ratios show the overabundance typical of halo stars of similar metallicity. Mn is underabundant, whereas Fe-group elements have typical abundance ratios near the solar value. We detect star-to-star differences in Al abundances from the RGB tip down to the faintest star below the RGB bump, correlated with Na abundances at all luminosities. The slope of the Na-Al correlation is similar to the one found in M13 by Sneden et al., but it is different from those in other globular clusters of similar metallicity. We find that the amount of chemical inhomogeneities along the Na-O and Mg-Al anticorrelations in globular cluster red giants is correlated with the present-day cluster mass and ellipticity. Moreover, we find for the first time a correlation between the spread in proton-capture elements and orbital parameters of clusters. The chemical anomalies are more extended in clusters having large-sized orbits and longer periods and those with larger inclination angles of the orbit with respect to the Galactic plane. Based on data collected at the European Southern Observatory, Chile, during the FLAMES Science Verification program with the Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph at the VLT-UT2.},

abstract = {We study with unprecedented detail the chemical composition and stellar parameters of the solar twin 18 Sco in a strictly differential sense relative to the Sun. Our study is mainly based on high-resolution (R {\textasciitilde} 110,000), high signal-to-noise ratio (800-1,000) Very Large Telescope UVES spectra, which allow us to achieve a precision of about 0.005 dex in differential abundances. The effective temperature and surface gravity of 18 Sco are T eff = 5823 {\textpm} 6 K and log g = 4.45 {\textpm} 0.02 dex, i.e., 18 Sco is 46 {\textpm} 6 K hotter than the Sun and log g is 0.01 {\textpm} 0.02 dex higher. Its metallicity is [Fe/H] = 0.054 {\textpm} 0.005 dex, and its microturbulence velocity is +0.02 {\textpm} 0.01 km s-1 higher than solar. Our precise stellar parameters and differential isochrone analysis show that 18 Sco has a mass of 1.04 {\textpm} 0.02 M ⊙ and that it is {\textasciitilde}1.6 Gyr younger than the Sun. We use precise High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS) radial velocities to search for planets, but none are detected. The chemical abundance pattern of 18 Sco displays a clear trend with condensation temperature, thus showing higher abundances of refractories in 18 Sco than in the Sun. Intriguingly, there are enhancements in the neutron-capture elements relative to the Sun. Despite the small element-to-element abundance differences among nearby n-capture elements ({\textasciitilde}0.02 dex), we successfully reproduce the r-process pattern in the Solar System. This is independent evidence for the universality of the r process. Our results have important implications for chemical tagging in our Galaxy and nucleosynthesis in general. Based on observations obtained at the European Southern Observatory (ESO) Very Large Telescope (VLT) at Paranal Observatory; the 3.6 m telescope at La Silla Observatory, Chile (observing programs 083.D-0871 and 188.C-0265); and at the W.M.

abstract = {Mayall II=G1 is one of the brightest globular clusters belonging to M31, the Andromeda galaxy. Our observations with the Wide Field and Planetary Camera (WFPC2) on board the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) provide photometric data for the I versus V-I and V versus V-I color-magnitude diagrams. They reach stars with magnitudes fainter than V=27 mag, with a well populated red horizontal branch at about V=25.3 mag. From model fitting, we determine a rather high mean metallicity of [Fe/H]=-0.95+/-0.09, somewhat similar to 47 Tucanae. In order to determine our true measurement errors, we have carried out artificial star experiments. We find a larger spread in V-I than can be explained by the measurement errors, and we attribute this to an intrinsic metallicity dispersion amongst the stars of G1; this may be the consequence of self-enrichment during the early stellar/dynamical evolutionary phases of this cluster. So far, only $\omega$ Centauri, the giant Galactic globular cluster, has been known to exhibit such an intrinsic metallicity dispersion, a phenomenon certainly related to the deep potential wells of these two star clusters. We determine, from the same HST/WFPC2 data, the structural parameters of G1. Its surface brightness profile provides its core radius rc=0.14"=0.52 pc, its tidal radius rt{\textasciitilde}=54''=200 pc, and its concentration c=log(rt/rc){\textasciitilde}=2.5. Such a high concentration indicates the probable collapse of the core of G1. KECK/HIRES observations provide the central velocity dispersion $\sigma$obs=25.1 km s-1, with $\sigma$p(0)=27.8 km s-1 once aperture corrected. Three estimates of the total mass of this globular cluster can be obtained. The King-model mass is MK=15{\texttimes}106 Msolar with M/LV{\textasciitilde}=7.5, and the virial mass is MVir=7.3{\texttimes}106 Msolar with M/LV{\textasciitilde}=3.6. By using a King-Michie model fitted simultaneously to the surface brightness profile and the central velocity dispersion value, mass estimates range from MKM=14{\texttimes}106 Msolar to 17{\texttimes}106 Msolar. Although uncertain, all of these mass estimates make G1 more than twice as massive as $\omega$ Centauri, the most massive Galactic globular cluster, whose mass is also uncertain by about a factor of 2. G1 is not unique in M31: at least three other bright globular clusters of this galaxy have velocity dispersions $\sigma$obs larger than 20 km s-1, implying probably similar large masses. Such large masses relate to the metallicity spread whose origin is still unknown (either self-enrichment, an inhomogeneous proto-cluster cloud, or remaining core of a dwarf galaxy). Let us consider for G1 the four following parameters: central surface brightness $\mu$(0, V)=13.47 mag arcsec-2, core radius rc=0.52 pc, integrated absolute visual magnitude MV=-10.94 mag, and central velocity dispersion $\sigma$(0)=28 km s-1. When considering the positions of G1 in the different diagrams defined by Kormendy using the above four parameters, G1 always appears on the sequence defined by globular clusters, and definitely away from the other sequences defined by elliptical galaxies, bulges, and dwarf spheroidal galaxies. The same is true for $\omega$ Centauri. Little is known about the positions, in these diagrams, of the nuclei of nucleated dwarf elliptical galaxies, which could be the progenitors of some of the most massive globular clusters. The above four parameters are known only for the nucleus of one dwarf elliptical, viz., NGC 205, and put this object, in the Kormendy's diagram, close to G1, right on the sequence of globular clusters. This does not prove that all (massive) globular clusters are the remnant cores of nucleated dwarf galaxies. At the moment, only the anticorrelation of metallicity with age recently observed in $\omega$ Centauri suggests that this cluster enriched itself over a timescale of about 3 Gyr. This contradicts the general idea that all the stars in a globular cluster are coeval and may favor the origin of $\omega$ Centauri as being the remaining core of a larger entity, e.g., of a former nucleated dwarf elliptical galaxy. In any case, the very massive globular clusters, by the mere fact that their large masses imply complicated stellar and dynamical evolution, may blur the former clear (or simplistic) difference between globular clusters and dwarf galaxies. Based in part on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555. These observations are associate with proposal IDs 5907 and 5464.},

Spectra centered on the 4300 {\AA} CH absorption band were taken for 42 bright red giants in 11 Galactic globular clusters ranging in metallicity from M92 ([Fe/H] = -2.29) to NGC 6712 ([Fe/H] = -1.01). Carbon abundances were derived by comparing values of the CH-band strength index S 2(CH) measured from the data with values measured from a large grid of SSG synthetic spectra. Present-day abundances are combined with theoretical calculations of the time since the onset of mixing, which is also a function of stellar metallicity, to calculate the carbon depletion rate across our metallicity range. We find that the carbon depletion rate is twice as high at a metallicity of [Fe/H] = -2.3 than at [Fe/H] = -1.3, which is a result qualitatively predicted by some theoretical explanations of the deep mixing process.},

abstract = {The Gaia-ESO survey is a large public spectroscopic survey aimed at investigating the origin and formation history of our Galaxy by collecting spectroscopy of representative samples (about 105 Milky Way stars) of all Galactic stellar populations, in the field and in clusters. The survey uses globular clusters as intra- and inter-survey calibrators, deriving stellar atmospheric parameters and abundances of a significant number of stars in clusters, along with radial velocity determinations. We used precise radial velocities of a large number of stars in seven globular clusters (NGC 1851, NGC 2808, NGC 4372, NGC 4833, NGC 5927, NGC 6752, and NGC 7078) to validate pipeline results and to preliminarily investigate the cluster internal kinematics. Radial velocity measurements were extracted from FLAMES/GIRAFFE spectra processed by the survey pipeline as part of the second internal data release of data products to ESO. We complemented our sample with ESO archival data obtained with different instrument configurations. Reliable radial velocity measurements for 1513 bona fide cluster star members were obtained in total. We measured systemic rotation, estimated central velocity dispersions, and present velocity dispersion profiles of all the selected clusters, providing the first velocity dispersion curve and the first estimate of the central velocitydispersion for the cluster NGC 5927. Finally, we explore the possible link between cluster kinematics and other physical parameters. The analysis we present here demonstrates that Gaia-ESO survey data are sufficiently accurate to be used in studies of kinematics of stellar systems and stellar populations in the Milky Way.

Thermonuclear Al26(p ,$\gamma$)Si27 reaction rates are determined using different assumed strengths for this resonance and representative stellar model calculations of these astrophysical environments are performed using these different rates. Predicted Al26 yields in our models are not sensitive to differences in rates determined using zero and a commonly stated upper limit corresponding to $\omega$$\gamma$UL=0.0042 $\mu$eV for this resonance strength. Yields of Al26 decrease by 6% and, more significantly, up to 30%, when a strength of 24{\texttimes}$\omega$$\gamma$UL=0.1 $\mu$eV is assumed in the adopted nova and AGB star models, respectively. Given that the value of $\omega$$\gamma$UL was deduced from a single, background-dominated Al26(He3,d )Si27 experiment where only upper limits on differential cross sections were determined, we encourage new experiments to confirm the strength of the 127-keV resonance.},

abstract = {A significant number of intermediate age clusters (1-2 Gyr) in the Magellanic Clouds appear to have multiple stellar populations within them, derived from bimodal or extended main-sequence turn-offs. If this is interpreted as an age spread, the multiple populations are separated by a few hundred million years, which would call into question the long-held notion that clusters are simple stellar populations. Here, we show that stellar rotation in stars with masses between 1.2 and 1.7Msolar can mimic the effect of a double or multiple population, whereas in actuality only a single population exists. The two main causes of the spread near the turn-off are the effects of stellar rotation on the structure of the star and the inclination angle of the star relative to the observer. Both effects change the observed effective temperature, hence colour, and flux of the star. In order to match observations, the required rotation rates are 20-50 per cent of the critical rotation, which are consistent with observed rotation rates of similar mass stars in the Galaxy. We provide scaling relations which can be applied to non-rotating isochrones in order to mimic the effects of rotation. Finally, we note that rotation is unlikely to be the cause of the multiple stellar populations observed in old globular clusters, as low-mass stars (<1Msolar) are not expected to be rapid rotators.},

abstract = {We demonstrate that the amount of extra mixing required to fit the observed low C/N and 12C/13C ratios in first giant branch (FGB) stars is also sufficient to explain the carbon and nitrogen abundances of Galactic asymptotic/second giant branch (AGB) stars. We simulate the effect of extra mixing on the FGB by setting the composition of the envelope to that observed in low-mass (M <= 2 M sun) FGB stars, and then evolve the models to the tip of the AGB. The inclusion of FGB extra mixing compositional changes has a strong effect on the C and N abundance in our AGB models, leading to compositions consistent with those measured in Galactic carbon-rich stars. The composition of the models is also consistent with C and N abundances measured in mainstream silicon carbide grains. While our models cover the range of C abundances measured in carbon stars in the LMC cluster NGC 1846, we cannot simultaneously match the composition of the O- and C-rich stars at the same time. A second important result is that our models only match the oxygen isotopic composition of K and some M, MS giants, and are not able to match the oxygen composition of carbon-rich AGB stars. By increasing the abundance of 16O in the intershell (based on observational evidence) it is possible to reproduce the observed trend of increasing 16O/18O and 16O/17O ratios with evolutionary phase. We also find that some Li production takes place during the AGB and that Li-rich carbon stars (log epsilon(Li) >{\textasciitilde} 1) can be produced. These models show a correlation between increasing Li abundances and C. The models cannot explain the composition of the most Li-enriched carbon stars, nor can we produce a Li-rich carbon star if we assume extra mixing occurs during the FGB owing to 3He destruction. We tentatively conclude that (1) if extra mixing occurs during the AGB it likely only occurs efficiently in low metallicity objects, or when the stars are heavily obscured making spectroscopic observations difficult and (2) the intershell compositions of AGB stars need further investigation.},

abstract = {A re-analysis of the fluorine abundance in three Galactic asymptotic giant branch (AGB) carbon stars (TX Psc, AQ Sgr, and R Scl) has been performed from the molecular HF (1-0) R9 line at 2.3358 $\mu$m. High resolution (R {\textasciitilde} 50,000) and high signal-to-noise spectra obtained with the CRIRES spectrograph and the VLT telescope or from the NOAO archive (for TX Psc) have been used. Our abundance analysis uses the latest generation of MARCS model atmospheres for cool carbon-rich stars. Using spectral synthesis in local thermodynamic equilibrium, we derive for these stars fluorine abundances that are systematically lower by {\textasciitilde}0.8 dex in average with respect to the sole previous estimates by Jorissen et al. The possible reasons of this discrepancy are explored. We conclude that the difference may rely on the blending with C-bearing molecules (CN and C2) that were not properly taken into account in the former study. The new F abundances are in better agreement with the prediction of full network stellar models of low-mass AGB stars. These models also reproduce the s-process elements distribution in the sampled stars. This result, if confirmed in a larger sample of AGB stars, might alleviate the current difficulty to explain the largest [F/O] ratios found by Jorissen et al. In particular, it may not be necessary to search for alternative nuclear chains affecting the production of F in AGB stars.},

abstract = {Context: The growing body of spectral observations of the extremely metal-poor (EMP) stars in the Galactic Halo provides constraints on theoretical studies of the chemical and stellar evolution of the early Universe. Aims: To calculate yields for EMP stars for use in chemical evolution calculations and to test whether such models can account for some of the recent abundance observations of EMP stars, in particular the highly C-rich EMP (CEMP) halo stars. Methods: We modify an existing 1D stellar structure code to include time-dependent mixing in a diffusion approximation. Using this code and a post-processing nucleosynthesis code we calculate the structural evolution and nucleosynthesis of a grid of models covering the metallicity range: -6.5 $\le$ [Fe/H] $\le$ -3.0 (plus Z = 0), and mass range: 0.85 $\le$ M $\le$ 3.0 M_⊙, amounting to 20 stars in total. Results: Many of the models experience violent nuclear burning episodes not seen at higher metallicities. We refer to these events as {\textquotedblleft}Dual Flashes{\textquotedblright} since they are characterised by nearly simultaneous peaks in both hydrogen and helium burning. These events have been reported by previous studies. Some of the material processed by the Dual Flashes is dredged up causing significant surface pollution with a distinct chemical composition. We have calculated the entire evolution of the Z=0 and EMP models, from the ZAMS to the end of the TPAGB, including extensive nucleosynthesis. In this paper, the first of a series describing and analysing this large data set, we present the resulting stellar yields. Although subject to many uncertainties these are, as far as we are aware, the only yields currently available in this mass and metallicity range. We also analyse the yields in terms of C and N, comparing them to the observed CEMP abundances. At the lowest metallicities ([Fe/H] ≲ -4.0) we find the yields to contain {\textasciitilde} 1 to 2 dex too much carbon, in agreement with all previous studies. At higher metallicities ([Fe/H] {\textasciitilde} -3.0), where the observed data set is much larger, all our models produce yields with [C/Fe] values consistent with those observed in the most C-rich CEMPs. However it is only the low-mass models that undergo the Dual Shell Flash (which occurs at the start of the TPAGB) that can best reproduce the C and N observations. Normal Third Dredge-Up can not reproduce the observations because at these metallicities intermediate mass models (M ≳ 2 M_⊙) suffer HBB which converts the C to N thus lowering [C/N] well below the observations, whilst if TDU were to occur in the low-mass (M $\le$ 1 M_⊙) models (we do not find it to occur in our models), the yields would be expected to be C-rich only, which is at odds with the {\textquotedblleft}dual pollution{\textquotedblright} of C and N generally observed in the CEMPs. Interestingly events similar to the EMP Dual Flashes have been proposed to explain objects similarly containing a dual pollution of C and N - the {\textquotedblleft}Blue Hook{\textquotedblright} stars and the {\textquotedblleft}Born Again AGB{\textquotedblright} stars. We also find that the proportion of CEMP stars should continue to increase at lower metallicities, based on the results that some of the low mass EMP models already have polluted surfaces by the HB phase, and that there are more C-producing evolutionary episodes at these metallicities. Finally we note that there is a need for multidimensional fluid dynamics calculations of the Dual Flash events, to ascertain whether the overproduction of C and N at ultra-low metallicities found by all studies is an artifact of the 1D treatment.

abstract = {The double or extended main-sequence turnoffs (MSTOs) in the color-magnitude diagram (CMD) of intermediate-age massive star clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud are generally interpreted as age spreads of a few hundred Myr. However, such age spreads do not exist in younger clusters (i.e., 40-300 Myr), which challenges this interpretation. The effects of rotation on the MSTOs of star clusters have been studied in previous works, but the results obtained are conflicting. Compared with previous works, we consider the effects of rotation on the main-sequence lifetime of stars. Our calculations show that rotating models have a fainter and redder MSTO with respect to non-rotating counterparts with ages between about 0.8 and 2.2 Gyr, but have a brighter and bluer MSTO when age is larger than 2.4 Gyr. The spread of the MSTO caused by a typical rotation rate is equivalent to the effect of an age spread of about 200 Myr. Rotation could lead to the double or extended MSTOs in the CMD of the star clusters with ages between about 0.8 and 2.2 Gyr. However, the extension is not significant, and it does not even exist in younger clusters. If the efficiency of the mixing were high enough, the effects of the mixing would counteract the effect of the centrifugal support in the late stage of evolution, and the rotationally induced extension would disappear in the old intermediate-age star clusters, but younger clusters would have an extended MSTO. Moreover, the effects of rotation might aid in understanding the formation of some "multiple populations" in globular clusters.},

abstract = {Calculations from stellar evolutionary models of low- and intermediate-mass asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars provide predictions of elemental abundances and yields for comparison to observations. However, there are many uncertainties that reduce the accuracy of these predictions. One such uncertainty involves the treatment of low-temperature molecular opacities that account for the surface abundance variations of C, N and O. A number of prior calculations of intermediate-mass AGB stellar models that incorporate both efficient third dredge-up and hot bottom burning include a molecular opacity treatment which does not consider the depletion of C and O due to hot bottom burning. Here we update the molecular opacity treatment and investigate the effect of this improvement on calculations of intermediate-mass AGB stellar models. We perform tests on two masses, 5 and 6 M⊙, and two metallicities, Z = 0.001 and 0.02, to quantify the variations between two opacity treatments. We find that several evolutionary properties (e.g. radius, Teff and Tbce) are dependent on the opacity treatment. Larger structural differences occur for the Z = 0.001 models compared to the Z = 0.02 models indicating that the opacity treatment has a more significant effect at lower metallicity. As a consequence of the structural changes, the predictions of isotopic yields are slightly affected with most isotopes experiencing changes up to 60 per cent for the Z = 0.001 models and 20 per cent for the Z = 0.02 models. Despite this moderate effect, we conclude that it is more fitting to use variable molecular opacities for models undergoing hot bottom burning.},

abstract = {We combine spectroscopic and photometric data for subgiant stars of $\omega$ Cen to extract results that neither data set could have provided on its own. GIRAFFE@VLT spectra of 80 stars at R=6400 give metallicities for all of them and abundances of C, N, Ca, Ti, and Ba for a subset of them. The photometric data, which have unusually high accuracy, come from a {\textasciitilde}10{\texttimes}10 arcmin2 mosaic of HST ACS images centered on the cluster center and on multicolor images of a {\textasciitilde}34{\texttimes}33 arcmin2 field, taken with the WFI@ESO2.2m camera. Stars with [Fe/H]<-1.25 have a large magnitude spread on the flat part of the SGB. We interpret this as empirical evidence for an age spread, and from theoretical isochrones we derive a relative age for each star. Within the SGB region we identify four distinct stellar groups: (1) an old, metal-poor group ([Fe/H]{\textasciitilde}-1.7) (2) an old, metal-rich group ([Fe/H]{\textasciitilde}-1.1) (3) a young (up to 4-5 Gyr younger than the old component) metal-poor group ([Fe/H]{\textasciitilde}-1.7) (4) a young, intermediate-metallicity ([Fe/H]{\textasciitilde}-1.4) group, on average 1-2 Gyr younger than the old metal-poor population, and with an age spread that we cannot properly quantify with the present sample. In addition, many SGB stars are spread between the intermediate-metallicity and metal-rich branches. We tentatively propose connections between the SGB stars and both the multiple main-sequence and the red giant branches. Finally, we discuss the implications of the multiple stellar populations on the formation and evolution of $\omega$ Cen. The spread in age within each population establishes that the original system must have had a composite nature.

We find that Li abundance anticorrelates with Na (and N) and correlates with O in these Turn-Off stars. For the first time we observe Pop II hot dwarfs systematically departing from the Spite plateau. The observed anticorrelations are in qualitative agreement with what is expected if the original gas were contaminated by Intermediate Mass AGB - processed material. However, a quantitative comparison shows that none of the existing models can reproduce all the observations at once. The very large amount of processed gas present in the cluster does not imply a {\textquotedblleft}pollution{\textquotedblright}, but rather that the whole protocluster cloud was enriched by a previous generation of stars. We finally note that the different abundance patterns in NGC 6397 and NGC 6752 imply different composition of the pre-enrichment ejecta for the two clusters.},

abstract = {Star-to-star abundance variations of C, N, O, Na and Al in globular-cluster red giants have been recently supplemented by the finding that [Mg/Fe] is depleted in stars with extremely large [Al/Fe] (Shetrone 1996a). To find out which of the magnesium isotopes is responsible for the observed depletion of [Mg/Fe] Shetrone (1996b) also undertook an isotopic analysis of Mg and found that it is (24) Mg which is depleted in Al-rich giants. On the other hand, Norris {\&} Da Costa (1995) demonstrated that even in the massive globular cluster omega Cen which has intrinsic spreads in both [Fe/H] and the abundances of the s-process elements, [O/Fe] anticorrelates with [Na/Fe] and [Al/Fe] as in ``normal'' monometallic clusters. These new spectroscopic results allow us to test current models of stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis, as well as those of the formation and chemical enrichment of globular clusters. In an effort to explain self-consistently these observations we have considered two possibilities: (1) a deep mixing scenario which assumes that in red giants some kind of (extra)mixing transports products of nuclear reactions from the hydrogen burning shell (HBS) to the base of the convective envelope; and (2) a combination of primordial and deep mixing scenarios. It is shown that (1) cannot account for the anticorrelation of [Mg/Fe] vs. [Al/Fe] without additional ad hoc assumptions, among which we identify a strong but still undetected low energy resonance in the reaction (24) Mg(p,gamma )(25) Al, and episodical increases of the HBS temperature up to the value T{\textasciitilde} 7410(6) K. In (2) intermediate mass AGB stars are assumed to produce the decreased (24) Mg and increased (25) Mg initial abundances in some globular-cluster low mass stars and Al is synthesized at the expense of (25) Mg in the HBS and transported to the surface of the red giant by extramixing. We discuss advantages and deficiencies of both scenarios and propose some observational tests.},

It then outlines our perceptions of the advantages and disadvantages of undertaking a PhD by publication. We suggest that, in general, the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.

abstract = {We present abundance measurements for a large number of neutron-capture elements in giant stars of the globular clusters M4, M5, and M13. The relative abundance ratios differ between all three clusters. For all clusters, we find that the mean abundances for the elements from Ba to Hf can be well explained by scaled versions of the solar s- and r-process abundances, albeit with different mixtures of s- and r-process material for each clusters.},

abstract = {We report on a strictly differential line-by-line analysis of high-quality UVES spectra of bright giants in the metal-poor globular cluster NGC 6752. We achieved high precision differential chemical abundance measurements for Fe, Na, Si, Ca, Ti, Cr, Ni, Zn, Y, Zr, Ba, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu and Dy with uncertainties as low as {\~{ }}0.01 dex ({\~{ }}2 per cent). We obtained the following main results. (1) The observed abundance dispersions are a factor of {\~{ }}2 larger than the average measurement uncertainty. (2) There are positive correlations, of high statistical significance, between all elements and Na. (3) For any pair of elements, there are positive correlations of high statistical significance, although the amplitudes of the abundance variations are small. Removing abundance trends with effective temperature and/or using a different pair of reference stars does not alter these results. These abundance variations and correlations may reflect a combination of (a) He abundance variations and (b) inhomogeneous chemical evolution in the pre- or protocluster environment. Regarding the former, the current constraints on $\Delta$Y from photometry likely preclude He as being the sole explanation. Regarding the latter, the nucleosynthetic source(s) must have synthesized Na, $\alpha$, Fe-peak and neutron-capture elements and in constant amounts for species heavier than Si; no individual object can achieve such nucleosynthesis. We speculate that other, if not all, globular clusters may exhibit comparable abundance variations and correlations to NGC 6752 if subjected to a similarly precise analysis.},

abstract = {After off-center C ignition in the cores of super asymptotic giant branch (SAGB) stars, the C flame propagates all the way down to the center, trailing behind it the C-shell convective zone, and thus building a degenerate ONe core. This standard picture is obtained in stellar evolution simulations if the bottom C-shell convection boundary is assumed to be a discontinuity associated with a strict interpretation of the Schwarzschild condition for convective instability. However, this boundary is prone to additional mixing processes, such as thermohaline convection and convective boundary mixing. Using hydrodynamic simulations, we show that contrary to previous results, thermohaline mixing is too inefficient to interfere with the C-flame propagation. However, even a small amount of convective boundary mixing removes the physical conditions required for the C-flame propagation all the way to the center. This result holds even if we allow for some turbulent heat transport in the CBM region. As a result, SAGB stars build in their interiors hybrid C-O-Ne degenerate cores composed of a relatively large CO core (M CO $\approx$ 0.2 M ⊙) surrounded by a thick ONe zone ($\Delta$M ONe >{\textasciitilde} 0.85 M ⊙) with another thin CO layer above. If exposed by mass loss, these cores will become hybrid C-O-Ne white dwarfs. Otherwise, the ignition of C-rich material in the central core, surrounded by the thick ONe zone, may trigger a thermonuclear supernova (SN) explosion. The quenching of the C-flame may have implications for the ignition mechanism of SN Ia in the double-degenerate merger scenario.},

Hydrodynamic simulations of the interior convection of AGB stars are now becoming available, giving insights to convective boundary mixing, for example for He-shell flash convection. At very low metallicity convective-reactive events are encountered in AGB stars (as well as in massive stars), and the necessity of hydrodynamic simulations to address this difficult phase of stellar evolution is emphasized.},

abstract = {Abundances of heavier elements (barium and beyond) in many neutron-capture-element-rich halo stars accurately replicate the solar system r-process pattern. However, abundances of lighter neutron-capture elements in these stars are not consistent with the solar system pattern. These comparisons suggest contributions from two distinct types of r-process synthesis events, a so-called main r-process for the elements above the second r-process peak and a weak r-process for the lighter neutron-capture elements. We have performed r-process theoretical predictions to further explore the implications of the solar and stellar observations. We find that the isotopic composition of barium and the elemental Ba/Eu abundance ratios in r-process-rich low-metallicity stars can only be matched by computations in which the neutron densities are in the range 23<{\textasciitilde}lognn<{\textasciitilde}28, values typical of the main r-process. For r-process conditions that successfully generate the heavy element pattern extending down to A=135, the relative abundance of 129I produced in this mass region appears to be at least {\textasciitilde}90% of the observed solar value. Finally, in the neutron number density ranges required for production of the observed solar/stellar third r-process-peak (A{\textasciitilde}200), the predicted abundances of interpeak element hafnium (Z=72, A{\textasciitilde}177-180) follow closely those of third-peak elements and lead. Hf, observable from the ground and close in mass number to the third r-process-peak elements, might also be used as part of a new nuclear chronometer pair, Th/Hf, for stellar age determinations.},

In this Letter, we present our results on Li abundances for a large sample of giants in the intermediate-metallicity GC NGC 6121 (M4), for which Na and O have been already determined by Marino et al. The stars analyzed are both below and above the red giant branch bump luminosity. We found that the first and second generation stars share the same Li content, suggesting that a Li production must have occurred. This provides strong observational evidence supporting the scenario in which asymptotic giant branch stars are GC polluters.},

abstract = {The ejected mass distribution of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) directly probes progenitor evolutionary history and explosion mechanisms, with implications for their use as cosmological probes. Although the Chandrasekhar mass is a natural mass scale for the explosion of white dwarfs as SNe Ia, models allowing SNe Ia to explode at other masses have attracted much recent attention. Using an empirical relation between the ejected mass and the light-curve width, we derive ejected masses Mej and 56Ni masses MNi for a sample of 337 SNe Ia with redshifts z < 0.7 used in recent cosmological analyses. We use hierarchical Bayesian inference to reconstruct the joint Mej-MNi distribution, accounting for measurement errors. The inferred marginal distribution of Mej has a long tail towards sub-Chandrasekhar masses, but cuts off sharply above 1.4 M⊙. Our results imply that 25-50 per cent of normal SNe Ia are inconsistent with Chandrasekhar-mass explosions, with almost all of these being sub-Chandrasekhar mass; super-Chandrasekhar-mass explosions make up no more than 1 per cent of all spectroscopically normal SNe Ia. We interpret the SN Ia width-luminosity relation as an underlying relation between Mej and MNi, and show that the inferred relation is not naturally explained by the predictions of any single known explosion mechanism.},

abstract = {We model the evolution of manganese relative to iron in the progenitor system of the globular cluster Omega Centauri by means of a self-consistent chemical evolution model. We use stellar yields that already reproduce the measurements of [Mn/Fe] versus [Fe/H] in Galactic field disc and halo stars, in Galactic bulge stars and in the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy. We compare our model predictions to the Mn abundances measured in a sample of 10 red giant members and six subgiant members of $\omega$ Cen. The low values of [Mn/Fe] observed in a few, metal-rich stars of the sample cannot be explained in the framework of our standard, homogeneous chemical evolution model. Introducing cooling flows that selectively bring to the cluster core only the ejecta from specific categories of stars does not help to heal the disagreement with the observations. The capture of field stars does not offer a viable explanation either. The observed spread in the data and the lowest [Mn/Fe] values could, in principle, be understood if the system experienced inhomogeneous chemical evolution. Such an eventuality is qualitatively discussed in this paper. However, more measurements of Mn in $\omega$ Cen stars are needed to settle the issue of Mn evolution in this cluster.},

abstract = {We construct a new model of Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia), based on the single degenerate scenario, taking account of the metallicity dependences of white dwarf (WD) wind and the mass-stripping effect on the binary companion star. Our model naturally predicts that SN Ia lifetime distribution spans a range of 0.1-20 Gyr with the double peaks at {\textasciitilde}0.1 and 1 Gyr. While the present SN Ia rate in elliptical galaxies can be reproduced with the old population of the red giants+WD systems, the large SN Ia rate in radio galaxies could be explained with the young population of the main-sequence+WD systems. Because of the metallicity effect, i.e., because of the lack of winds from WDs in the binary systems, the SN Ia rate in the systems with [Fe/H] lsim-1, e.g., high-z spiral galaxies, is supposed to be very small. Our SN Ia model can give better reproduction of the [($\alpha$, Mn, Zn)/Fe]-[Fe/H] relations in the solar neighborhood than other models such as the double-degenerate scenario. The metallicity effect is more strongly required in the presence of the young population of SNe Ia. We also succeed in reproducing the galactic supernova rates with their dependence on the morphological type of galaxies, and the cosmic SN Ia rate history with a peak at z {\textasciitilde} 1. At z gsim 1, the predicted SN Ia rate decreases toward higher redshifts and SNe Ia will be observed only in the systems that have evolved with a short timescale of chemical enrichment. This suggests that the evolution effect in the supernova cosmology can be small.},

Differential analysis reveals that in NGC 6752 sodium and aluminum are enhanced in the CN-strong stars by approximately 0.5 dex and 0.2 dex, respectively. All other elements studied (Mg, Si, Ca, Fe, and Ba) appear to have identical abundances in the two groups of stars. In 47 Tuc, only sodium shows any enhancement (by about 0.4 dex) in the CN-strong stars. Since sodium and aluminum are not produced during the evolution of low-mass stars, these abundance enhancements in the CN-strong stars cannot be due to mixing. They must be primordial in origin and indicate that each protocluster gas cloud was not homogeneous during the epoch of low-mass star formation. A process by which both the sodium and cyanogen anomalies might be produced is described.},

abstract = {The 22Ne($\alpha$,n)25Mg reaction is thought to be the neutron source during the s process in massive and intermediate mass stars as well as a secondary neutron source during the s process in low-mass stars. Therefore, an accurate determination of this rate is important for a better understanding of the origin of nuclides heavier than iron as well as for improving s-process models. Also, the s process produces seed nuclides for a later p process in massive stars, so an accurate value for this rate is important for a better understanding of the p process. Because the lowest observed resonance in direct 22Ne($\alpha$,n)25Mg measurements is considerably above the most important energy range for s-process temperatures, the uncertainty in this rate is dominated by the poorly known properties of states in 26Mg between this resonance and threshold. Neutron measurements can observe these states with much better sensitivity and determine their parameters (except $\Gamma$$\alpha$) much more accurately than direct 22Ne($\alpha$,n)25Mg measurements. I have analyzed previously reported natMg+n total and 25Mg(n,$\gamma$) cross sections to obtain a much improved set of resonance parameters for states in 26Mg between threshold and the lowest observed 22Ne($\alpha$,n)25Mg resonance, and an improved estimate of the uncertainty in the 22Ne($\alpha$,n)25Mg reaction rate. For example, definitely two, and very likely at least four, of the states in this region have natural parity and hence can contribute to the 22Ne($\alpha$,n)25Mg reaction, but two others definitely have non-natural parity and so can be eliminated from consideration. As a result, a recent evaluation in which it was assumed that only one of these states has natural parity has underestimated the reaction rate uncertainty by at least a factor of 10, whereas evaluations that assumed all these states could contribute probably have overestimated the uncertainty.},

abstract = {Recent AGB models including diffusive overshoot or rotational effects suggest the partial mixing (PM) of protons from the H-rich envelope into the C-rich layers during the third dredge-up. In order to study the impact of such a mixing on the surface abundances, nucleosynthesis calculations based on stellar AGB models are performed for different assumptions of protons (ranging from X_pmix=10-6 to 0.7) in the PM zone. For high proton-to-12C abundance ratios, light nuclei such as fluorine and sodium are efficiently produced, while heavier s-process nuclei are synthesized for lower proton-to-12C ratios. In the framework of the PM model, assuming a smooth exponentially decreasing proton profile, the surface 19F abundance evolution is correlated with that of s-process nuclei in agreement with observations. However, as a function of the surface C/O abundance ratio, the surface 19F enrichment remains difficult to reconcile with observations in AGB stars. Sodium is predicted to be efficiently produced in a small region of the PM zone with proton-to-12C abundance ratio of about 10, but with large overproduction factors (up to fifty times higher than the sodium left over by the hydrogen burning shell). The primary 13C pocket formed in the PM zone at low proton-to-12C ratios is responsible for an efficient production of s-process nuclei. A table of elemental overabundances predicted at the surface of AGB stars at four different metallicities is presented. All the nucleosynthesis calculations are shown to suffer from major nuclear reaction rate uncertainties, in particular, 13C (p,$\gamma$) 14N, 14N (n,p) 14C and 22Ne ($\alpha$,n) 25Mg. The major uncertainties associated with the amount of protons mixed into the C-rich zone are found in the extent of the PM zone rather than in the adopted H profile. Finally, the PM scenario predicts that low-metallicity AGB stars enriched in s-process elements should exhibit a large overproduction of Pb and Bi compared to other s-isotopes. The search of such Pb-stars is highly encouraged.},

abstract = {We present homogeneous abundance determinations for iron and some of the elements involved in the proton-capture reactions (O, Na, Mg, Al, and Si) for 202 red giants in 17 Galactic globular clusters (GCs) from the analysis of high-resolution UVES spectra obtained with the FLAMES facility at the ESO VLT2 telescope. Our programme clusters span almost the whole range of the metallicity distribution of GCs and were selected to sample the widest range of global parameters (horizontal-branch morphology, masses, concentration, etc.). In this paper we focus on the discussion of the Na-O and Mg-Al anticorrelations and related issues. Our study finds clear Na and O star-to-star abundance variations, exceeding those expected from the error in the analysis, in all clusters. Variations in Al are present in all but a few GCs. Finally, a spread in abundances of Mg and Si are also present in a few clusters. Mg is slightly less overabundant and Si slightly more overabundant in the most Al-rich stars. The correlation between Si and Al abundances is a signature of production of 28Si leaking from the Mg-Al cycle in a few clusters. The cross sections required for the proper reactions to take over in the cycle point to temperatures in excess of about 65 million K for the favoured site of production. We used a dilution model to infer the total range of Al abundances starting from the Na and Al abundances in the FLAMES-UVES spectra, and the Na abundance distributions found from analysis of the much larger set of stars for which FLAMES-GIRAFFE spectra were available. We found that the maximum amount of additional Al produced by first-generation polluters contributing to the composition of the second-generation stars in each cluster is closely correlated with the same combination of metallicity and cluster luminosity that reproduced the minimum O-abundances found from GIRAFFE spectra. We then suggest that the high temperatures required for the Mg-Al cycle are only reached in the most massive and most metal-poor polluters.

abstract = {We present the first evolutionary models of intermediate mass stars up to their thermal pulses which include effects of rotation on the stellar structure as well as rotationally induced mixing of chemical species and angular momentum. We find a significant angular momentum transport from the core to the hydrogen-rich envelope and obtain a white dwarf rotation rate comparable to current observational upper limits of ≲ 50 km s(-1) . Large angular momentum gradients at the bottom of the convective envelope and the tip of the pulse driven convective shell are shown to produce marked chemical mixing between the proton-rich and the (12) C-rich layers during the so called third dredge-up. This leads to a subsequent production of (13) C which is followed by neutron production through (13) C(alpha , n) in radiative layers in between thermal pulses. Although uncertainties in the efficiency of rotational mixing processes persist, we conclude that rotation is capable of producing a (13) C-rich layer as required for the occurrence of the s-process in TP-AGB stars.},

Instead, the model evolves rapidly to higher luminosities in a short time without a corresponding rapid increase of the stellar core. At the canonical AGB luminosity limit, the stellar core has still only 0.93 solar mass, and the model is further increasing its luminosity at a high rate beyond this limit. The observed high lithium abundances of some AGB stars as well as the luminosity region in which they are found can be explained by the model.},

abstract = {WMAP precision data enable accurate testing of cosmological models. We find that the emerging standard model of cosmology, a flat $\Lambda$-dominated universe seeded by a nearly scale-invariant adiabatic Gaussian fluctuations, fits the WMAP data. For the WMAP data only, the best-fit parameters are h=0.72+/-0.05, $\Omega$bh2=0.024+/-0.001, $\Omega$mh2=0.14+/-0.02, $\tau$=0.166+0.076-0.071, ns=0.99+/-0.04, and $\sigma$8=0.9+/-0.1. With parameters fixed only by WMAP data, we can fit finer scale cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements and measurements of large-scale structure (galaxy surveys and the Ly$\alpha$ forest). This simple model is also consistent with a host of other astronomical measurements: its inferred age of the universe is consistent with stellar ages, the baryon/photon ratio is consistent with measurements of the [D/H] ratio, and the inferred Hubble constant is consistent with local observations of the expansion rate. We then fit the model parameters to a combination of WMAP data with other finer scale CMB experiments (ACBAR and CBI), 2dFGRS measurements, and Ly$\alpha$ forest data to find the model's best-fit cosmological parameters: h=0.71+0.04-0.03, $\Omega$bh2=0.0224+/-0.0009, $\Omega$mh2=0.135+0.008-0.009, $\tau$=0.17+/-0.06, ns(0.05 Mpc-1)=0.93+/-0.03, and $\sigma$8=0.84+/-0.04. WMAP's best determination of $\tau$=0.17+/-0.04 arises directly from the temperature-polarization (TE) data and not from this model fit, but they are consistent. These parameters imply that the age of the universe is 13.7+/-0.2 Gyr. With the Ly$\alpha$ forest data, the model favors but does not require a slowly varying spectral index. The significance of this running index is sensitive to the uncertainties in the Ly$\alpha$ forest. By combining WMAP data with other astronomical data, we constrain the geometry of the universe, $\Omega$tot=1.02+/-0.02, and the equation of state of the dark energy, w<-0.78 (95% confidence limit assuming w>=-1). The combination of WMAP and 2dFGRS data constrains the energy density in stable neutrinos: $\Omega$$\nu$h2<0.0072 (95% confidence limit). For three degenerate neutrino species, this limit implies that their mass is less than 0.23 eV (95% confidence limit). The WMAP detection of early reionization rules out warm dark matter. WMAP is the result of a partnership between Princeton University and the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. Scientific guidance is provided by the WMAP Science Team.},

abstract = {Metal-poor globular clusters (MPGCs) are a unique probe of the early universe, in particular the reionization era. A popular hypothesis is that the observed truncation of MPGC formation is due to reionization. Under this hypothesis, constraining the formation epoch of MPGCs provides a complementary constraint on the epoch of reionization. Moreover, as the earliest reionizing sources first formed in galaxy clusters, systems of globular clusters in galaxy clusters are of particular interest. We provide a self-consistent dark matter only zoom cosmological simulation to perform an analysis of the Virgo cluster globular cluster system by identifying the present-day globular cluster system with early, rare dark matter peaks. By analysing both the line-of-sight velocity dispersion and the surface density profile of the present-day distribution, we are able to constrain the redshift and mass of the dark matter peaks. Although found to be degenerate, we quantify a dependence on the chosen line of sight of these quantities, whose strength varies with redshift. Coupled with star formation efficiency arguments, we find a best-fitting formation mass and redshift of ≃5 {\texttimes} 108 M⊙ and z ≃ 9. We predict ≃300 intracluster MPGCs in the Virgo cluster. Our results confirm the techniques pioneered by Moore et al. when applied to the Virgo cluster and extend and justify the analytic results of Spitler et al. numerically.},

Our models include fully consistent transport of angular momentum and chemicals due to the combined action of rotation induced mixing (according to Maeder {\&} Zahn \cite{Maeder98}) and element segregation. The analysis of the effects of local variations of molecular weight due to the meridional circulation on the transport of angular momentum and chemicals are under the scope of this study. We apply this mechanism to low mass main sequence and subgiant stars of population I. We show that the so-called mu -currents are of major importance in setting the shape of the rotation profile, specially near the core. Furthermore, as shown by Talon {\&} Charbonnel (\cite{Talon98}) and Charbonnel {\&} Talon (\cite{Charbonnel99}) using models without mu -currents, we confirm that rotation-induced mixing in stars braked via magnetic torquing can explain the blue side of the Li dip, as well as the low Li abundances observed in subgiants even when mu -currents are taken into account. We emphasize that mu variations are not to be neglected when treating rotation-induced mixing, and that they could be of great importance for latter evolutionary stages.},

abstract = {We revisit the observed frequencies of carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars as a function of the metallicity in the Galaxy, using data from the literature with available high-resolution spectroscopy. Our analysis excludes stars exhibiting clear overabundances of neutron-capture elements and takes into account the expected depletion of surface carbon abundance that occurs due to CN processing on the upper red giant branch. This allows for the recovery of the initial carbon abundance of these stars, and thus for an accurate assessment of the frequencies of carbon-enhanced stars. The correction procedure we develop is based on stellar-evolution models and depends on the surface gravity, log g, of a given star. Our analysis indicates that for stars with [Fe/H] <=-2.0, 20% exhibit [C/Fe] >=+0.7. This fraction increases to 43% for [Fe/H] <=-3.0 and 81% for [Fe/H] <=-4.0, which is higher than have been previously inferred without taking the carbon abundance correction into account. These CEMP star frequencies provide important inputs for Galactic and stellar chemical evolution models, as they constrain the evolution of carbon at early times and the possible formation channels for the CEMP-no stars. We also have developed a public online tool with which carbon corrections using our procedure can be easily obtained.},

abstract = {Background: The ratio between the rates of the reactions 17O($\alpha$,n)20Ne and 17O($\alpha$,$\gamma$)21Ne determines whether 16O is an efficient neutron poison for the s process in massive stars, or if most of the neutrons captured by 16O(n,$\gamma$) are recycled into the stellar environment. This ratio is of particular relevance to constrain the s process yields of fast rotating massive stars at low metallicity.Purpose: Recent results on the ($\alpha$,$\gamma$) channel have made it necessary to measure the ($\alpha$,n) reaction more precisely and investigate the effect of the new data on s process nucleosynthesis in massive stars.Method: The 17O($\alpha$,n(0+1)) reaction has been measured with a moderating neutron detector. In addition, the ($\alpha$,n1) channel has been measured independently by observation of the characteristic 1633 keV $\gamma$ transition in 20Ne. The reaction cross section was determined with a simultaneous R-matrix fit to both channels. ($\alpha$,n) and ($\alpha$,$\gamma$) resonance strengths of states lying below the covered energy range were estimated using their known properties from the literature.Result: The reaction channels 17O($\alpha$,n0)20Ne and 17O($\alpha$,n1$\gamma$)20Ne were measured in the energy range E$\alpha$=800 keV to 2300 keV. A new 17O($\alpha$,n) reaction rate was deduced for the temperature range 0.1 GK to 10 GK. At typical He burning temperatures, the combination of the new ($\alpha$,n) rate with a previously measured ($\alpha$,$\gamma$) rate gives approximately the same ratio as current compilations. The influence on the nucleosynthesis of the s process in massive stars at low metallicity is discussed.Conclusions: It was found that in He burning conditions the ($\alpha$,$\gamma$) channel is strong enough to compete with the neutron channel. This leads to a less efficient neutron recycling compared to a previous suggestion of a very weak ($\alpha$,$\gamma$) channel. S process calculations using our rates confirm that massive rotating stars do play a significant role in the production of elements up to Sr, but they strongly reduce the s process contribution to heavier elements.},

We measure abundances of Al, Ba, Ca, Fe, Ni, Si, and Ti and we find that these stars have {\textlangle}[Fe/H]{\textrangle} = -0.73 {\textpm} 0.14 dex, similarly to the corresponding red giant branch population (the RGB-a). We also measure {\textlangle}[$\alpha$/Fe]{\textrangle} = + 0.40 {\textpm} 0.16 dex, and {\textlangle}[Ba/Fe]{\textrangle} = + 0.87 {\textpm} 0.23 dex, in general agreement with past studies. It is very interesting to note that we found a uniform Al abundance, {\textlangle}[Al/Fe]{\textrangle} = + 0.32 {\textpm} 0.14 dex, for all the 18 SGB-a stars analysed here, thus supporting past evidence that the usual (anti-)correlations are not present in this population, and suggesting a non globular cluster-like origin of this particular population. In the dwarf galaxy hypothesis for the formation of $\omega$ Cen, this population might be the best candidate for the field population of its putative parent galaxy, although some of its properties appear contradictory. It has also been suggested that the most metal-rich population in $\omega$ Cen is significantly enriched in helium. If this is true, the traditional abundance analysis techniques, based on model atmospheres with normal helium content, might lead to errors. We have computed helium enhanced atmospheres for three stars in our sample and verified that the abundance errors due to the use of non-enhanced atmospheres are negligible. Additional, indirect support to the enhanced helium content of the SGB-a population comes from our Li upper limits. Based on observations with the ESO GIRAFFE@VLT, under programme 079.D-0021(A).

abstract = {We present a detailed chemical tagging of individual stellar populations in the Galactic globular cluster (GC) NGC 1851. Abundances are derived from FLAMES spectra for the largest sample of giants (124) and the most extensive number of elements ever analysed in this peculiar GC. The chemistry is characterised using homogeneous abundances of proton-capture (O, Na, Mg, Al, Si), $\alpha$-capture (Ca, Ti), Fe-peak (Sc, V, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu), and neutron-capture elements (Y, Zr, Ba, La, Ce, Nd, Eu, Dy). We confirm the presence of an [Fe/H] spread larger than the observational errors in this cluster, but too small to clearly separate different sub-populations. We instead propose a classification scheme using a combination of Fe and Ba (which is much more abundant in the more metal-rich group) by means of a cluster analysis. With this approach, we separated stars into two components of a metal-rich (MR) and a metal-poor (MP) population. Each component displays a Na-O anticorrelation, which is a signature of a genuine GC, but has different ratios of primordial (FG) to polluted (SG) stars. Moreover, clear (anti)correlations of Mg and Si with Na and O are found for each component. The level of [$\alpha$/H] tracks iron and is higher in the MR population, which might therefore have received an additional contribution from core-collapse supernovae. When considering all s-process elements, the MR population shows a larger enrichment than the MP one. This is probably due to the contribution of intermediate-low mass stars, because we find that the level of heavy s-process elements is higher than that of light s-process nuclei in the MR stars; however, a large contribution from low mass stars is unlikely, because it would likely cancel the O-Na anticorrelation. Finally, we confirm the presence of correlations between the amount of proton-capture elements and the level of s-process elements previously found by other investigations, at least for the MR population. This finding apparently requires a quite long delay for the second generation of the MR component. Scenarios for the formation of NGC 1851 appear complex, and are not yet well understood. A merger of two distinct GCs in a parent dwarf galaxy, each cluster with a different Ba level and an age difference of {\textasciitilde}1 Gyr, might explain (i) the double subgiant branch; (ii) a possible difference in C content between the two original GCs; and (iii) the Str{\"o}mgren photometry of this peculiar cluster. However, the correlation existing between p-capture and n-capture elements within the MR population requires the additional assumption of a long delay for its second generation. More observations are required to fully understand the formation of this GC.

abstract = {We present high-quality ground-based spectroscopic observations of 54 supergiant H II regions in 50 low-metallicity blue compact galaxies with oxygen abundances 12+logO/H between 7.1 and 8.3. We use the data to determine abundances for the elements N, O, Ne, S, Ar, and Fe. We also analyze Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Faint Object Spectrograph archival spectra of 10 supergiant H II regions to derive C and Si abundances in a subsample of seven BCGs. The main result of the present study is that none of the heavy element-to-oxygen abundance ratios studied here (C/O, N/O, Ne/O, Si/O, S/O, Ar/O, Fe/O) depend on oxygen abundance for BCGs with 12+logO/H<=7.6 (Z<=Z_solar/20). This constancy implies that all of these heavy elements have a primary origin and are produced by the same massive (M>=10 M_solar) stars responsible for O production. The dispersion of the ratios C/O and N/O in these galaxies is found to be remarkably small, being only +/-0.03 and +/-0.02 dex, respectively. This very small dispersion is strong evidence against any time-delayed production of C and primary N in the lowest metallicity BCGs (secondary N production is negligible at these low metallicities). The absence of a time-delayed production of C and N is consistent with the scenario that galaxies with 12+logO/H<=7.6 are now undergoing their first burst of star formation, and that they are therefore young, with ages not exceeding 40 Myr. If very low metallicity BCGs are indeed young, this would argue against the commonly held belief that C and N are produced by intermediate-mass (3 M_solar<=M<=9 M_solar) stars at very low metallicities, as these stars would not have yet completed their evolution in these lowest metallicity galaxies. In higher metallicity BCGs (7.6<12+logO/H<8.2), the abundance ratios Ne/O, Si/O, S/O, Ar/O, and Fe/O retain the same constant value they had at lower metallicities. By contrast, there is an increase of C/O and N/O along with their dispersions at a given O. We interpret this increase as due to the additional contribution of C and primary N production in intermediate-mass stars, on top of that by high-mass stars. The above results lead to the following timeline for galaxy evolution: (1) all objects with 12+logO/H<=7.6 began to form stars less than 40 Myr ago; (2) after 40 Myr, all galaxies have evolved so that 12+logO/H>7.6 (3) by the time intermediate-mass stars have evolved and released their nucleosynthetic products (100-500 Myr), all galaxies have become enriched to 7.6<12+logO/H<8.2. The delayed release of primary N at these metallicities greatly increases the scatter in N/O; (4) later, when galaxies get enriched to 12+logO/H>8.2, secondary N production becomes important. BCGs show the same O/Fe overabundance with respect to the Sun ({\textasciitilde}0.4 dex) as Galactic halo stars, suggesting the same chemical enrichment history. We compare heavy elements yields derived from the observed abundance ratios with theoretical yields for massive stars and find general good agreement. However, the theoretical models are unable to reproduce the observed N/O and Fe/O. Further theoretical developments are necessary, in particular to solve the problem of primary nitrogen production in low-metallicity massive stars. We discuss the apparent discrepancy between abundance ratios N/O measured in BCGs and those in high-redshift damped Lyalpha galaxies, which are up to 1 order of magnitude smaller. We argue that this large discrepancy may arise from the unknown physical conditions of the gas responsible for the metallic absorption lines in high-redshift damped Lyalpha systems. While it is widely assumed that the absorbing gas is neutral, we propose that it could be ionized. In this case, ionization correction factors can boost N/O in damped Lyalpha galaxies into the range of those measured in BCGs.},

abstract = {Roughly half of the heavy elements (atomic mass greater than that of iron) are believed to be synthesized in the late evolutionary stages of stars with masses between 0.8 and 8 solar masses. Deep inside the star, nuclei (mainly iron) capture neutrons and progressively build up (through the slow-neutron-capture process, or s-process) heavier elements that are subsequently brought to the stellar surface by convection. Two neutron sources, activated at distinct temperatures, have been proposed: 13C and 22Ne, each releasing one neutron per $\alpha$-particle (4He) captured. To explain the measured stellar abundances, stellar evolution models invoking the 13C neutron source (which operates at temperatures of about one hundred million kelvin) are favoured. Isotopic ratios in primitive meteorites, however, reflecting nucleosynthesis in the previous generations of stars that contributed material to the Solar System, point to higher temperatures (more than three hundred million kelvin), requiring at least a late activation of 22Ne (ref. 1). Here we report a determination of the s-process temperature directly in evolved low-mass giant stars, using zirconium and niobium abundances, independently of stellar evolution models. The derived temperature supports 13C as the s-process neutron source. The radioactive pair 93Zr-93Nb used to estimate the s-process temperature also provides, together with the pair 99Tc-99Ru, chronometric information on the time elapsed since the start of the s-process, which we determine to be one million to three million years.},

Since globular clusters are the only environment known in which stars form with this pattern of atypical light-element abundances, we claim that these stars are second-generation globular cluster stars that have been lost to the halo field via normal cluster mass-loss processes. Extrapolating from theoretical models of two-generation globular cluster formation, this result suggests that globular clusters contributed significant numbers of stars to the construction of the Galactic halo: we calculate that a minimum of 17% of the present-day mass of the stellar halo was originally formed in globular clusters. The ratio of CN-strong to CN-normal stars drops with Galactocentric distance, suggesting that the inner-halo population may be the primary repository of these stars.

abstract = {Improvements in Monte Carlo techniques for computing synthetic spectra of supernovae (SNe) are described and tested using a simplified model for the atmosphere of a Type Ia SN. In the first innovation, a procedure is implemented that replaces the previously-assumed line formation by resonance scattering with a branching model using Sobolev escape probabilities, and the resulting improvement is demonstrated by comparison with exact calculations for Fe Ii. In a second innovation, greatly accelerated convergence is achieved in the computation of emergent spectra by replacing the crude procedure of binning escaping Monte Carlo quanta with one based on the formal integral for emergent intensity. This is made possible by extracting line- and continuum source functions from a Monte Carlo simulation. Because of accelerated convergence, the required size of the Monte Carlo simulations is reduced by a factor {\textasciitilde} 300, thus greatly speeding up the calculation of model spectra and thereby allowing interactive diagnostic analyses of the spectra of newly-discovered SNe.},

The kinematics of the cluster have been compared with a set of dynamical models accounting for the effect of mass segregation and a variable fraction of binaries. The derived velocity dispersion appears to be larger than that predicted for mass-segregated stellar systems without binaries, indicating that either the cluster is dynamically young or it contains a large fraction of binaries (>30 per cent). We detected seven stars with a radial velocity compatible with the cluster systemic velocity but with chemical patterns which stray from those of both the cluster and the Galactic field. These stars are likely members of the Sagittarius stream surrounding this stellar system.},

abstract = {We determine the dynamical distance D, inclination i, mass-to-light ratio M/L and the intrinsic orbital structure of the globular cluster $\omega$ Cen, by fitting axisymmetric dynamical models to the ground-based proper motions of van Leeuwen et al. and line-of-sight velocities from four independent data-sets. We bring the kinematic measurements onto a common coordinate system, and select on cluster membership and on measurement error. This provides a homogeneous data-set of 2295 stars with proper motions accurate to 0.20 mas yr-1 and 2163 stars with line-of-sight velocities accurate to 2 km s-1, covering a radial range out to about half the tidal radius. We correct the observed velocities for perspective rotation caused by the space motion of the cluster, and show that the residual solid-body rotation component in the proper motions (caused by relative rotation of the photographic plates from which they were derived) can be taken out without any modelling other than assuming axisymmetry. This also provides a tight constraint on D tan i. The corrected mean velocity fields are consistent with regular rotation, and the velocity dispersion fields display significant deviations from isotropy. We model $\omega$ Cen with an axisymmetric implementation of Schwarzschild's orbit superposition method, which accurately fits the surface brightness distribution, makes no assumptions about the degree of velocity anisotropy in the cluster, and allows for radial variations in M/L. We bin the individual measurements on the plane of the sky to search efficiently through the parameter space of the models. Tests on an analytic model demonstrate that this approach is capable of measuring the cluster distance to an accuracy of about 6 per cent. Application to $\omega$ Cen reveals no dynamical evidence for a significant radial dependence of M/L, in harmony with the relatively long relaxation time of the cluster. The best-fit dynamical model has a stellar V-band mass-to-light ratio M/L_V=2.5{\textpm}0.1 M_⊙/L_⊙ and an inclination i=50{\textdegree}{\textpm}4{\textdegree}, which corresponds to an average intrinsic axial ratio of 0.78{\textpm}0.03. The best-fit dynamical distance D=4.8{\textpm}0.3 kpc (distance modulus 13.75{\textpm}0.13 mag) is significantly larger than obtained by means of simple spherical or constant-anisotropy axisymmetric dynamical models, and is consistent with the canonical value 5.0{\textpm}0.2 kpc obtained by photometric methods. The total mass of the cluster is (2.5{\textpm}0.3){\texttimes}106 M_⊙. The best-fit model is close to isotropic inside a radius of about 10 arcmin and becomes increasingly tangentially anisotropic in the outer region, which displays significant mean rotation. This phase-space structure may well be caused by the effects of the tidal field of the Milky Way. The cluster contains a separate disk-like component in the radial range between 1 and 3 arcmin, contributing about 4% to the total mass.},

abstract = {Carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars are observed as a substantial fraction of the very metal-poor stars in the Galactic halo. Most CEMP stars are also enriched in s-process elements, and these are often found in binary systems. This suggests that the carbon enrichment is due to mass transfer in the past from an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star on to a low-mass companion. Models of binary population synthesis are not able to reproduce the observed fraction of CEMP stars without invoking non-standard nucleosynthesis or a substantial change in the initial mass function. This is interpreted as evidence of missing physical ingredients in the models. Recent hydrodynamical simulations show that efficient wind mass transfer is possible in the case of the slow and dense winds typical of AGB stars through a mechanism called wind Roche-lobe overflow (WRLOF), which lies in between the canonical Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) accretion and Roche-lobe overflow. WRLOF has an effect on the accretion efficiency of mass transfer and on the angular momentum lost by the binary system. The aim of this work is to understand the overall effect of WRLOF on the population of CEMP stars. To simulate populations of low-metallicity binaries we combined a synthetic nucleosynthesis model with a binary population synthesis code. In this code we implemented the WRLOF mechanism. We used the results of hydrodynamical simulations to model the effect of WRLOF on the accretion efficiency, and we took the effect on the angular momentum loss into account by assuming a simple prescription. The combination of these two effects widens the range of systems that become CEMP stars towards longer initial orbital periods and lower mass secondary stars. As a consequence the number of CEMP stars predicted by our model increases by a factor 1.2-1.8 compared to earlier results that consider the BHL prescription. Moreover, higher enrichments of carbon are produced, and the final orbital period distribution is shifted towards shorter periods.},

abstract = {Spectroscopic observations of the chemical abundances in metal-poor H II regions provide an independent method for estimating the primordial helium abundance. H II regions are described by several physical parameters such as electron density, electron temperature, and reddening, in addition to y, the ratio of helium to hydrogen. It had been customary to estimate or determine self-consistently these parameters to calculate y. Frequentist analyses of the parameter space have been shown to be successful in these parameter determinations, and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques have proven to be very efficient in sampling this parameter space. Nevertheless, accurate determination of the primordial helium abundance from observations of H II regions is constrained by both systematic and statistical uncertainties. In an attempt to better reduce the latter, and continue to better characterize the former, we apply MCMC methods to the large dataset recently compiled by Izotov, Thuan, {\&} Stasi{\'{n}}ska (2007). To improve the reliability of the determination, a high quality dataset is needed. In pursuit of this, a variety of cuts are explored. The efficacy of the He I $\lambda$4026 emission line as a constraint on the solutions is first examined, revealing the introduction of systematic bias through its absence. As a clear measure of the quality of the physical solution, a $\chi$2 analysis proves instrumental in the selection of data compatible with the theoretical model. Nearly two-thirds of the observations fall outside a standard 95% confidence level cut, which highlights the care necessary in selecting systems and warrants further investigation into potential deficiencies of the model or data. In addition, the method also allows us to exclude systems for which parameter estimations are statistical outliers. As a result, the final selected dataset gains in reliability and exhibits improved consistency. Regression to zero metallicity yields Yp = 0.2534 {\textpm} 0.0083, in broad agreement with the WMAP result. The inclusion of more observations shows promise for further reducing the uncertainty, but more high quality spectra are required.},

abstract = {A new, comprehensive set of low-temperature opacity data has been assembled. From this basic data set, Rosseland and Planck mean opacities have been computed for temperatures between 12,500 and 700 K. In addition to the usual continuous absorbers, atomic line absorption (with more than 8 million lines), molecular line absorption (with nearly 60 million lines), and grain absorption and scattering (by silicates, iron, carbon, and SiC) have been accounted for. The absorption due to lines is computed monochromatically and included in the mean with the opacity sampling technique. Grains are assumed to form in chemical equilibrium with the gas and to form into a continuous distribution of ellipsoids. Agreement of these opacities with other recent tabulations of opacities for temperatures above 5000 K is excellent. It is shown that opacities which neglect molecules become unreliable for temperatures below 5000 K. Triatomic molecules become important absorbers at 3200 K. Similarly, grains must be included in the computation for temperatures below 1700 K.},

abstract = {It has been conclusively shown, using the data for 81 O and B stars, of luminosity classes Ia(+) to V, including Of and Be stars, that the rate of mass loss per unit time per unit stellar surface area increases with increase in rotational velocity. To discern the effect clearly, it is desirable to consider as large a sample of stars as possible, of small and large v sin i (where v is the linear rotational velocity and i is the angle the line of sight makes with the axis of rotation), ensuring proper randomization of the angle i. Two separate expressions are, however, required, one for Be-like stars and the other for the remaining O and B stars. The two groups can be combined if the dominant cause of mass loss is substracted out; in this case, if the angular rotational velocity is used rather than linear velocity, the correlation is tighter.},

abstract = {Aims: We study the impact of a subsolar metallicity on various properties of non-rotating and rotating stars, such as surface velocities and abundances, lifetimes, evolutionary tracks, and evolutionary scenarios. Methods: We provide a grid of single star models covering a mass range of 0.8 to 120 M⊙ with an initial metallicity Z = 0.002 with and without rotation. We discuss the impact of a change in the metallicity by comparing the current tracks with models computed with exactly the same physical ingredients but with a metallicity Z = 0.014 (solar). Results: We show that the width of the main-sequence (MS) band in the upper part of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (HRD), for luminosity above log (L/L⊙) > 5.5, is very sensitive to rotational mixing. Strong mixing significantly reduces the MS width. Here for the first time over the whole mass range, we confirm that surface enrichments are stronger at low metallicity provided that comparisons are made for equivalent initial mass, rotation, and evolutionary stage. We show that the enhancement factor due to a lowering of the metallicity (all other factors kept constant) increases when the initial mass decreases. Present models predict an upper luminosity for the red supergiants (RSG) of log (L/L⊙) around 5.5 at Z = 0.002 in agreement with the observed upper limit of RSG in the Small Magellanic Cloud. We show that models using shear diffusion coefficient, which is calibrated to reproduce the surface enrichments observed for MS B-type stars at Z = 0.014, can also reproduce the stronger enrichments observed at low metallicity. In the framework of the present models, we discuss the factors governing the timescale of the first crossing of the Hertzsprung gap after the MS phase. We show that any process favouring a deep localisation of the H-burning shell (steep gradient at the border of the H-burning convective core, low CNO content), and/or the low opacity of the H-rich envelope favour a blue position in the HRD for the whole, or at least a significant fraction, of the core He-burning phase.

abstract = {We compare the current effects of rotation in stellar evolution to those of the magnetic field created by the Tayler instability. In stellar regions, where a magnetic field can be generated by the dynamo due to differential rotation (Spruit \cite{Spruit02}), we find that the growth rate of the magnetic instability is much faster than for the thermal instability. Thus, meridional circulation is small with respect to the magnetic fields, both for the transport of angular momentum and of chemical elements. Also, the horizontal coupling by the magnetic field, which reaches values of a few 105 G, is much more important than the effects of the horizontal turbulence. The field, however, is not sufficient to distort the shape of the equipotentials. We impose the condition that the energy of the magnetic field created by the Tayler-Spruit dynamo cannot be larger than the energy excess present in the differential rotation. This leads to a criterion for the existence of the magnetic field in stellar interiors. Numerical tests are made in a rotating star model of 15 Msun rotating with an initial velocity of 300 km s-1. We find that the coefficients of diffusion for the transport of angular momentum by the magnetic field are several orders of magnitude larger than the transport coefficients for meridional circulation and shear mixing. The same applies to the diffusion coefficients for the chemical elements; however, very close to the core, the strong mu -gradient reduces the mixing by the magnetic instability to values not too different from the case without magnetic field. We also find that magnetic instability is present throughout the radiative envelope, with the exception of the very outer layers, where differential rotation is insufficient to build the field, a fact consistent with the lack of evidence of strong fields at the surface of massive stars. However, the equilibrium situation reached by a rotating star with magnetic field and rotation is still to be ascertained.},

abstract = {We present results for a suite of 14 three-dimensional, high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations of delayed-detonation models of Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) explosions. This model suite comprises the first set of three-dimensional SN Ia simulations with detailed isotopic yield information. As such, it may serve as a data base for Chandrasekhar-mass delayed-detonation model nucleosynthetic yields and for deriving synthetic observables such as spectra and light curves. We employ a physically motivated, stochastic model based on turbulent velocity fluctuations and fuel density to calculate in situ the deflagration-to-detonation transition probabilities. To obtain different strengths of the deflagration phase and thereby different degrees of pre-expansion, we have chosen a sequence of initial models with 1, 3, 5, 10, 20, 40, 100, 150, 200, 300 and 1600 (two different realizations) ignition kernels in a hydrostatic white dwarf with a central density of 2.9 {\texttimes} 109 g cm-3, as well as one high central density (5.5 {\texttimes} 109 g cm-3) and one low central density (1.0 {\texttimes} 109 g cm-3) rendition of the 100 ignition kernel configuration. For each simulation, we determined detailed nucleosynthetic yields by post-processing 106 tracer particles with a 384 nuclide reaction network. All delayed-detonation models result in explosions unbinding the white dwarf, producing a range of 56Ni masses from 0.32 to 1.11 M⊙. As a general trend, the models predict that the stable neutron-rich iron-group isotopes are not found at the lowest velocities, but rather at intermediate velocities ({\~{ }}3000-10 000 km s-1) in a shell surrounding a 56Ni-rich core. The models further predict relatively low-velocity oxygen and carbon, with typical minimum velocities around 4000 and 10 000 km s-1, respectively.},

The Galactic enrichment of barium is studied by taking into account nucleosynthesis contributions from both low-mass Type II supernovae (SNIIs), via a primary r-process, and low-mass asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, through a metal-dependent s-process. Recent calculations of neutron captures in stars of 1.5-3 M_solar and different metallicities provide the Ba yields from the AGB stars; the Ba yields from SNIIs are derived from considerations about the solar system composition. Our simulations show that these two Ba sources can explain both the [Ba/Fe] versus [Fe/H] behavior as derived from high-resolution spectroscopic observations of F-K giants, including the large spread of [Ba/Fe] observed at low metallicities, and the ratio between the r- and s-process contributions to solar barium.},

abstract = {Studies of carbon stars and M stars in several external star complexes have demonstrated conclusively that low-mass asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars of intermediate and low metallicity transform from M stars into C stars. This transformation occurs at a bolometric luminosity brighter than -4. One of the objectives of the present study is to examine theoretical light curves in the small core mass, small M case in more detail than appears in most earlier studies in order to investigate the core mass dependence of the magnitude and duration of the extended luminosity dip which follows a thermal pulse. It is shown that convective dredge-up of carbon to the surface does not occur in standard AGB models of small mass until the core mass approaches a value of approximately 0.7 solar mass. Attention is given to the time dependence of observables for 0.6 solar mass and 0.7 solar mass models, the fine-structure time dependence for the models, and the properties of convective regions.},

abstract = {Context. We reassess the problem of the production and evolution of the light elements Li, Be and B and of their isotopes in the Milky Way in the light of new observational and theoretical developments. Aims: The main novelty is the introduction of a new scheme for the origin of Galactic cosmic rays (GCR), which for the first time enables a self-consistent calculation of their composition during galactic evolution. Methods: The scheme accounts for key features of the present-day GCR source composition, it is based on the wind yields of the Geneva models of rotating, mass-losing stars and it is fully coupled to a detailed galactic chemical evolution code. Results: We find that the adopted GCR source composition accounts naturally for the observations of primary Be and helps understanding why Be follows Fe more closely than O. We find that GCR produce {\textasciitilde}70% of the solar 11B/10B isotopic ratio; the remaining 30% of 11B presumably result from $\nu$-nucleosynthesis in massive star explosions. We find that GCR and primordial nucleosynthesis can produce at most {\textasciitilde}30% of solar Li. At least half of the solar Li has to originate in low-mass stellar sources (red giants, asymptotic giant branch stars, or novae), but the required average yields of those sources are found to be much higher than obtained in current models of stellar nucleosynthesis. We also present radial profiles of LiBeB elemental and isotopic abundances in the Milky Way disc. We argue that the shape of those profiles - and the late evolution of LiBeB in general - reveals important features of the production of those light elements through primary and secondary processes.},

abstract = {Energy release from radioactive decays contributes significantly to supernova light curves. Previous works, which considered the energy deposited by $\gamma$-rays and positrons produced by 56Ni, 56Co, 57Ni, 57Co, 44Ti and 44Sc, have been quite successful in explaining the light curves of both core collapse and thermonuclear supernovae. We point out that Auger and internal conversion electrons, together with the associated X-ray cascade, constitute an additional heat source. When a supernova is transparent to $\gamma$-rays, these electrons can contribute significantly to light curves for reasonable nucleosynthetic yields. In particular, the electrons emitted in the decay of 57Co, which are largely due to internal conversion from a fortuitously low-lying 3/2- state in the daughter 57Fe, constitute an additional significant energy-deposition channel. We show that when the heating by these electrons is accounted for, a slow-down in the light curve of SN 1998bw is naturally obtained for typical hypernova nucleosynthetic yields. Additionally, we show that for generic Type Ia supernova yields, the Auger electrons emitted in the ground-state to ground-state electron capture decay of 55Fe exceed the energy released by the 44Ti decay chain for many years after the explosion.},

Here, we summarize new observational constraints, address recent progress in modeling Type Ia supernovae by means of three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations, and discuss several of the still open questions. It will be be shown that the new models have considerable predictive power which allows us to study observable properties such as light curves and spectra without adjustable non-physical parameters. This is a necessary requisite to improve our understanding of the explosion mechanism and to settle the question of the applicability of SNe Ia as distance indicators for cosmology. We explore the capabilities of the models by comparing them with observations and we show how such models can be applied to study the origin of the diversity of SNe Ia.},

abstract = {The results of stellar evolution calculations from the main sequence through to the end of the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase with mass loss are presented. It is shown that typical low mass AGB stars naturally suffer one or more superwind phases of mass loss toward the end of the AGB. These superwinds occur during the latter parts of the quiescent phases of helium shell flash cycles. The mass loss rates produced by the superwinds are similar to those required for PN production, and the occurrence of multiple superwind phases can account for the existence of AGB stars with hollow shells and multiple shell PNs. Each superwind phase leads to the loss of a few tenths of a solar mass. The mass loss rate used are based on empirical determinations for AGB stars; comparisons of model predictions with observations suggest that these rates can be used to model AGB evolution realistically.},

abstract = {There is growing observational evidence that the variability of red giants could be caused by self-excitation of global modes of oscillation. The most recent evidence of such oscillations was reported for $\alpha$UMa by Buzasi et al. who analysed space photometric data from the WIRE satellite. Little is understood concerning the oscillation properties in red giants. In this paper we address the question as to whether excited radial and non-radial modes can explain the observed variability in red giants. In particular, we present the results of numerical computations of oscillation properties of a model of $\alpha$UMa and of several models of a 2-Msolar star in the red giant phase. The red giant stars that we have studied have two cavities that can support oscillations: the inner core that supports gravity (g) waves and the outer one that supports acoustic (p) waves. Most of the modes in the p-mode frequency range are g modes confined in the core; those modes with frequencies close to a corresponding characteristic frequency of a p mode in the outer cavity are of mixed character and have substantial amplitudes in the outer cavity. We have shown that such modes of low degree, l=1 and 2, together with the radial (p) modes, can be unstable. The linear growth rates of these non-radial modes are similar to those of corresponding radial modes. In the model of $\alpha$UMa and in the 2-Msolar models in the lower regions of the giant branch, high amplitudes in the p-mode cavity arise only for modes with l=2. We have been unable to explain the observed oscillation properties of $\alpha$UMa, either in terms of mode instability or in terms of stochastic excitation by turbulent convection. The modes with the lowest frequencies, which exhibit the largest amplitudes and may correspond to the first three radial modes, are computed to be unstable if all of the effects of convection are neglected in the stability analyses. However, if the Lagrangian perturbations of the turbulent fluxes (heat and momentum) are taken into account in the pulsation calculation, only modes with higher frequencies are found to be unstable. The observed frequency dependence of amplitudes reported by Buzasi et al. does not agree with what one expects from stochastic excitation. This mechanism predicts an amplitude of the fundamental mode about two orders of magnitude smaller than the amplitudes of modes with orders n>=5, which is in stark disagreement with the observations.},

abstract = {We present results from new, detailed computations of lithium production by hot bottom burning (HBB) in asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars of intermediate mass (3.5 <= M <= 6 M_sun). The dependence of lithium production on stellar mass, metallicity, mass loss rate, convection and overshooting are discussed. In particular, nuclear burning, turbulent mixing and convective overshooting (if any) are self-consistently coupled by a diffusive algorithm, and the Full Spectrum of Turbulence (FST) model of convection is adopted, with test comparisons to Mixing Length Theory (MLT) stellar models. All the evolutions are followed from pre-main sequence down to late AGB, when stars do not appear any longer lithium rich. A ``reference mass" of 6 M_sun has been chosen since, although relatively close to the upper limit for which degenerate (12) C ignition occurs, all the studied mechanisms show up more clearly. HBB is always found above {\textasciitilde} log L/L_sun = 4.4, but the range of (initial) masses reaching HBB is largely dependent on convection model, overshooting and metallicity. For solar chemistry, masses >= 4M_sun evolve through HBB in the FST case and including core overshooting whereas, with solarly tuned MLT models and no overshooting, only masses >= 6M_sun can reach HBB. These constraints can give feedbacks about the more correct convection model and/or the extent of overshooting, thanks to the signatures of HBB in AGB stars in clusters of known turnoff masses and metallicity. Overshooting (when included) is addressed as an exponentially decreasing diffusion above formally convective regions. It makes convective cores during the main sequence to grow larger, and also starting masses and luminosities in AGB are then larger. However, also preliminary results obtained when allowing displacement of convective elements below convective regions in AGB are shown. In the ``reference" case (6M_sun), we find that overshooting from below the convective envelope totally suppresses thermal pulses and ultimately leads to the formation of massive ( {\textasciitilde} 1M_sun) white dwarfs rich in Carbon and Oxygen immediately below the photosphere.},

The abundance seeds are obtained by calculating s-process nucleosynthesis in the material accreted onto a carbon-oxygen white dwarf from a binary companion. A fine grid of s-seeds at different metallicities and 13C-pocket efficiencies is considered. A galactic chemical evolution model is used to predict the contribution of SN Ia to the solar system p-nuclei composition measured in meteorites. Nuclear physics uncertainties are critical to determine the role of SNe Ia in the production of 92Nb and 146Sm.

abstract = {High resolution (R ⪆ 40 000) and high S/N spectra have been acquired with UVES on the VLT-Kueyen (Paranal Observatory, ESO Chile) for several main sequence turnoff stars (V {\~{ }} 17 mag) and subgiants at the base of the Red Giant Branch (V {\~{ }} 16 mag) in three globular clusters (NGC 6397, NGC 6752 and 47 Tuc/NGC 104) at different metallicities (respectively [Fe/H] ≃ -2.0; -1.5; -0.7). Spectra for a sample of 25 field halo subdwarves have also been taken with equal resolution, but higher S/N. These data have been used to determine the abundances of several neutron-capture elements in these three clusters: strontium, yttrium, barium and europium. This is the first abundance determination of these heavy elements for such unevolved stars in these three globular clusters. These values, together with the [Ba/Eu] and [Sr/Ba] abundance ratios, have been used to test the self-enrichment scenario. A comparison is done with field halo stars and other well known Galactic globular clusters in which heavy elements have already been measured in the past, at least in bright giants (V ⪆ 11-12 mag). Our results show clearly that globular clusters have been uniformly enriched by r- and s-process syntheses, and that most of them seem to follow exactly the same abundance patterns as field halo stars, which discards the ``classical'' self-enrichment scenario for the origin of metallicities and heavy elements in globular clusters. Based on data collected at the European Southern Observatory with the VLT-UT2, Paranal, Chile (ESO-LP 165.L-0263).},

abstract = {A growing number of low luminosity and low surface brightness astronomical objects challenge traditional notions of both galaxies and star clusters. To address this challenge, we propose a definition of galaxy that does not depend on a cold dark matter model of the universe: a galaxy is a gravitationally bound collection of stars whose properties cannot be explained by a combination of baryons and Newton's laws of gravity. After exploring several possible observational diagnostics of this definition, we critically examine the classification of ultra-faint dwarfs, globular clusters, ultra-compact dwarfs, and tidal dwarfs. While kinematic studies provide an effective diagnostic of the definition in many regimes, they can be less useful for compact or very faint systems. To explore the utility of using the [Fe/H] spread as a complementary diagnostic, we use published spectroscopic [Fe/H] measurements of 16 Milky Way dwarfs and 24 globular clusters to uniformly calculate their [Fe/H] spreads and associated uncertainties. Our principal results are (1) no known, old star cluster less luminous than MV = -10 has a significant (gsim0.1 dex) spread in its iron abundance; (2) known ultra-faint dwarf galaxies can be unambiguously classified with a combination of kinematic and [Fe/H] observations; (3) the observed [Fe/H] spreads in massive (gsim 106 M ⊙) globular clusters do not necessarily imply that they are the stripped nuclei of dwarfs, nor a need for dark matter; and (4) if ultra-compact dwarf galaxies reside in dark matter halos akin to those of ultra-faint dwarfs of the same half-light radii, then they will show no clear dynamical signature of dark matter. We suggest several measurements that may assist the future classification of massive globular clusters, ultra-compact dwarfs, and ultra-faint galaxies. Our galaxy definition is designed to be independent of the details of current observations and models, while our proposed diagnostics can be refined or replaced as our understanding of the universe evolves.},

abstract = {Context. Observationally, spectra of brown dwarfs indicate the presence of dust in their atmospheres while theoretically it is not clear what prevents the dust from settling and disappearing from the regions of spectrum formation. Consequently, standard models have to rely on ad hoc assumptions about the mechanism that keeps dust grains aloft in the atmosphere. Aims: We apply hydrodynamical simulations to develop an improved physical understanding of the mixing properties of macroscopic flows in M dwarf and brown dwarf atmospheres, in particular of the influence of the underlying convection zone. Methods: We performed two-dimensional radiation hydrodynamics simulations including a description of dust grain formation and transport with the CO5BOLD code. The simulations cover the very top of the convection zone and the photosphere including the dust layers for a sequence of effective temperatures between 900 K and 2800 K, all with log g = 5 assuming solar chemical composition. Results: Convective overshoot occurs in the form of exponentially declining velocities with small scale heights, so that it affects only the region immediately above the almost adiabatic convective layers. From there on, mixing is provided by gravity waves that are strong enough to maintain thin dust clouds in the hotter models. With decreasing effective temperature, the amplitudes of the waves become smaller but the clouds become thicker and develop internal convective flows that are more efficient in transporting and mixing material than gravity waves. The presence of clouds often leads to a highly structured appearance of the stellar surface on short temporal and small spatial scales (presently inaccessible to observations). Conclusions: We identify convectively excited gravity waves as an essential mixing process in M dwarf and brown dwarf atmospheres. Under conditions of strong cloud formation, dust convection is the dominant self-sustaining mixing component.},

The H$\alpha$ images are dominated by emission from hydrogen atoms crossing the reverse shock (RS). For the first time we observe emission from the RS surface well above and below the equatorial ring (ER), suggesting a bipolar or conical structure perpendicular to the ring plane. Using the H$\alpha$ imaging, we measure the mass flux of hydrogen atoms crossing the RS front, in the velocity intervals (-7500 < Vobs < -2800 km s-1) and (1000 < Vobs < 7500 km s-1), \dot{{{M}H}} = 1.2 {\texttimes} 10-3 M ⊙ yr-1. We also present the first Ly$\alpha$ imaging of the whole remnant and new Chandra X-ray observations. Comparing the spatial distribution of the Ly$\alpha$ and X-ray emission, we observe that the majority of the high-velocity Ly$\alpha$ emission originates interior to the ER. The observed Ly$\alpha$/H$\alpha$ photon ratio, < R(L$\alpha$ /H$\alpha$ ) > $\approx$ 17, is significantly higher than the theoretically predicted ratio of $\approx$5 for neutral atoms crossing the RS front. We attribute this excess to Ly$\alpha$ emission produced by X-ray heating of the outer debris. The spatial orientation of the Ly$\alpha$ and X-ray emission suggests that X-ray heating of the outer debris is the dominant Ly$\alpha$ production mechanism in SN 1987 A at this phase in its evolution.},

abstract = {Massive stars are key sources of radiative, kinetic and chemical feedback in the Universe. Grids of massive star models computed by different groups each using their own codes, input physics choices and numerical approximations, however, lead to inconsistent results for the same stars. We use three of these 1D codes - GENEC, KEPLER and MESA - to compute non-rotating stellar models of 15, 20 and 25 M⊙ and compare their nucleosynthesis. We follow the evolution from the main sequence until the end of core helium burning. The GENEC and KEPLER models hold physics assumptions used in large grids of published models. The MESA code was set up to use convective core overshooting such that the CO core masses are consistent with those obtained by GENEC. For all models, full nucleosynthesis is computed using the NuGrid post-processing tool MPPNP. We find that the surface abundances predicted by the models are in reasonable agreement. In the helium core, the standard deviation of the elemental overproduction factors for Fe to Mo is less than 30 per cent - smaller than the impact of the present nuclear physics uncertainties. For our three initial masses, the three stellar evolution codes yield consistent results. Differences in key properties of the models, e.g. helium and CO core masses and the time spent as a red supergiant, are traced back to the treatment of convection and, to a lesser extent, mass loss. The mixing processes in stars remain the key uncertainty in stellar modelling. Better constrained prescriptions are thus necessary to improve the predictive power of stellar evolution models.},

abstract = {We present measurements of the neutron-capture elements Rb and Pb in five giant stars of the globular cluster NGC 6752 and Pb measurements in four giants of the globular cluster M13. The abundances were derived by comparing synthetic spectra with high-resolution, high signal-to-noise ratio spectra obtained using HDS on the Subaru telescope and MIKE on the Magellan telescope. The program stars span the range of the O-Al abundance variation. In NGC 6752, the mean abundances are [Rb/Fe]=-0.17+/-0.06 ($\sigma$=0.14), [Rb/Zr]=-0.12+/-0.06 ($\sigma$=0.13), and [Pb/Fe]=-0.17+/-0.04 ($\sigma$=0.08). In M13 the mean abundance is [Pb/Fe]=-0.28+/-0.03 ($\sigma$=0.06). Within the measurement uncertainties, we find no evidence for star-to-star variation for either Rb or Pb within these clusters. None of the abundance ratios [Rb/Fe], [Rb/Zr], or [Pb/Fe] are correlated with the Al abundance. NGC 6752 may have slightly lower abundances of [Rb/Fe] and [Rb/Zr] compared to the small sample of field stars at the same metallicity. For M13 and NGC 6752 the Pb abundances are in accord with predictions from a Galactic chemical evolution model. If metal-poor intermediate-mass asymptotic giant branch stars did produce the globular cluster abundance anomalies, then such stars do not synthesize significant quantities of Rb or Pb. Alternatively, if such stars do synthesize large amounts of Rb or Pb, then they are not responsible for the abundance anomalies seen in globular clusters.

abstract = {Stellar lifetimes and initial mass function are basic ingredients of chemical evolution models, for which different recipes can be found in the literature. In this paper, we quantify the effects on chemical evolution studies of the uncertainties in these two parameters. We concentrate on chemical evolution models for the Milky Way, because of the large number of good observational constraints. Such chemical evolution models have already ruled out significant temporal variations for the stellar initial mass function in our own Galaxy, with the exception perhaps of the very early phases of its evolution. Therefore, here we assume a Galactic initial mass function constant in time. Through an accurate comparison of model predictions for the Milky Way with carefully selected data sets, it is shown that specific prescriptions for the initial mass function in particular mass ranges should be rejected. As far as the stellar lifetimes are concerned, the major differences among existing prescriptions are found in the range of very low-mass stars. Because of this, the model predictions differ widely for those elements which are produced mostly by very long-lived objects, as for instance 3He and 7Li. However, we conclude that model predictions of several important observed quantities, constraining the plausible Galactic formation scenarios, are fairly robust with respect to changes in both the stellar mass spectrum and lifetimes. For instance, the metallicity distribution of low-mass stars is nearly unaffected by these changes, since its shape is dictated mostly by the time scale for thin-disk formation.},

In this work, we find that the abundance patterns of the light and iron group elements of the main r-process stars are very close to those of the weak r-process stars. Based on a detailed abundance comparison, we find that the weak r-process occurs in supernovae with a progenitor mass range of {\~{ }}11-26 M⊙. Using the SN yields given by Heger {\&} Woosley and the abundances of the weak r-process stars, the weak r-process yields are derived. The SNe with a progenitor mass range of 15 M⊙ < M < 26 M⊙ are the main sites of the weak r-process, and their contributions are larger than 80%. Using the abundance ratios of the weak r-process and the main r-process in the solar system, the average yields of the main r-process are estimated.

abstract = {Abundance variations within globular clusters (GCs), and of GC stars with respect to field stars, are important diagnostics of a variety of physical phenomena, related to the evolution of individual stars, mass transfer in binary systems, and chemical evolution in high density environments. The broad astrophysical implications of GCs as building blocks of our knowledge of the Universe make a full understanding of their history and evolution basic in a variety of astrophysical fields. We review the current status of the research in this field, comparing the abundances in GCs with those obtained for field stars, discussing in depth the evidence for H-burning at high temperatures in GC stars, describing the process of self-enrichment in GCs with particular reference to the case of the most massive Galactic GC ( Cen), and discussing various classes of cluster stars with abundance anomalies. Whereas the overall pattern might appear very complex at first sight, exciting new scenarios are opening where the interplay between GC dynamical and chemical properties are closely linked with each other.},

abstract = {We present an abundance analysis of 101 subgiant branch (SGB) stars in the globular cluster M 22. Using low-resolution FLAMES/GIRAFFE spectra we have determined abundances of the neutron-capture strontium and barium and the light element carbon. With these data we explore relationships between the observed SGB photometric split in this cluster and two stellar groups characterized by different contents of iron, slow neutron-capture process (s-process) elements, and the $\alpha$ element calcium, which we previously discovered in M 22's red-giant stars. We show that the SGB stars correlate in chemical composition and the color-magnitude diagram position. The stars with higher metallicity and relative s-process abundances define a fainter SGB, while stars with lower metallicity and s-process content reside on a relatively brighter SGB. This result has implications for the relative ages of the two stellar groups of M 22. In particular, it is inconsistent with a broad spread in ages of the two SGBs. By accounting for the chemical content of the two stellar groups, isochrone fitting of the double SGB suggests that their agesare not different by more than {\textasciitilde}300 Myr.

abstract = {The magnetorotational instability (MRI) is key to physics in accretion disks and is widely considered to play some role in massive star core collapse. Models of rotating massive stars naturally develop very strong shear at composition boundaries, a necessary condition for MRI instability, and the MRI is subject to triply diffusive destabilizing effects in radiative regions. We have used the MESA stellar evolution code to compute magnetic effects due to the Spruit-Tayler (ST) mechanism and the MRI, separately and together, in a sample of massive star models. We find that the MRI can be active in the later stages of massive star evolution, leading to mixing effects that are not captured in models that neglect the MRI. The MRI and related magnetorotational effects can move models of given zero-age main sequence mass across "boundaries" from degenerate CO cores to degenerate O/Ne/Mg cores and from degenerate O/Ne/Mg cores to iron cores, thus affecting the final evolution and the physics of core collapse. The MRI acting alone can slow the rotation of the inner core in general agreement with the observed "initial" rotation rates of pulsars. The MRI analysis suggests that localized fields {\textasciitilde}1012 G may exist at the boundary of the iron core. With both the ST and MRI mechanisms active in the 20 M ⊙ model, we find that the helium shell mixes entirely out into the envelope. Enhanced mixing could yield a population of yellow or even blue supergiant supernova progenitors that would not be standard SN IIP.},

abstract = {Improvements of the mixing-length theory (MLT) of turbulent convection in stellar atmospheres are developed theoretically. It is pointed out that inaccuracies are introduced into MLT by the approximating assumptions of a single large eddy (rather than many eddies of different sizes) and of incompressibility. In the proposed new model, the full spectrum of turbulent eddies is determined using more recent turbulence models (e.g., the eddy-damped quasi-normal Markovian model of Orszag, 1977), and a new formula for the convective flux is obtained which gives values up to 10 times greater than those of the MLT at high convective efficiencies. The problem of compressibility is addressed by adding one of two new expressions (one with no free parameters) for the mixing length. Numerical results from simulations of a solar-type star and a 0.8-solar-mass globular-cluster star are presented in tables and graphs and discussed in detail; the agreement with observations is found to be better than with the MLT.},

abstract = {The chemical composition and core masses of thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch (TP-AGB) models of bulge stars are calculated using a synthetic model. The goal is to infer typical progenitor masses and compositions by reproducing the typical chemical composition and central star masses of planetary nebulae (PNe) in the Galactic bulge. The AGB-tip luminosity and the observed lack of bright carbon stars in the bulge are matched by the models. Five sets of Galactic bulge PNe were analysed to find typical abundances and masses of the central stars of planetary nebulae (CSPNs). These global parameters were matched by the AGB models. These sets are shown to be consistent with the most massive CSPNs having the largest abundances of helium and heavy elements. The CSPN masses of the most helium-rich (He/H ≳ 0.130 or Y ≳ 0.34) PNe are estimated to be between 0.58 and 0.62 M⊙. The oxygen abundance in the form log (O/H) + 12 of these highest-mass CSPNs is estimated to be {\~{ }}8.85. TP-AGB models with zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) masses between 1.2 and 1.8 M⊙ with YZAMS $\approx$ 0.31-0.33 and ZZAMS $\approx$ 0.019-0.022 fit the typical global parameters, mass and abundances of the highest-mass CSPNs. The inferred ZAMS helium abundance of the most metal-enriched stars implies that dY/dZ {\~{ }} 4 for the Galactic bulge. These models produce no bright carbon stars, in agreement with observations of the bulge. They produce an AGB-tip luminosity for the bulge in agreement with observations and suggest that the youngest main sequence stars in the Galactic bulge have an enhanced helium abundance (Y $\approx$ 0.32) and ages between 2 and 4 Gyr. The chemical evolution of nitrogen in the Galactic bulge inferred from the models is consistent with the cosmic evolution inferred from H ii regions and unevolved stars. The inferred ZAMS N/O ratios (log N/O $\approx$ -0.35) of the bulge PNe with the largest CSPN masses are shown to be above the solar ratio. The inferred ZAMS N/O ratios of the entire range of PN metallicities is consistent with both primary and secondary production of nitrogen contributing to the chemical evolution of nitrogen in the Galactic bulge. The inferred ZAMS value of C/O is less than 1. This indicates that the masses of the PN progenitors are low enough (M ≲ 1.8 M⊙) that carbon stars are not produced via the third dredge-up.},

The [Fe/H] values we found are -2.03+/- 0.02+/- 0.04\ and -1.42+/- 0.02+/- 0.04\ for NGC 6397 and NGC 6752 respectively, where the first error bars refer to internal and the second ones to systematic errors (within the abundance scale defined by our analysis of 25 subdwarfs with good Hipparcos parallaxes). In both clusters the [Fe/H]'s obtained for TO-stars agree perfectly (within a few percent) with that obtained for stars at the base of the RGB. The [O/Fe]=0.21+/- 0.05 value we obtain for NGC 6397 is quite low, but it agrees with previous results obtained for giants in this cluster. Moreover, the star-to-star scatter in both O and Fe is very small, indicating that this small mass cluster is chemically very homogenous. On the other hand, our results show clearly and for the first time that the O-Na anticorrelation (up to now seen only for stars on the red giant branches of globular clusters) is present among unevolved stars in the globular cluster NGC 6752, a more massive cluster than NGC 6397. A similar anticorrelation is present also for Mg and Al, and C and N. It is very difficult to explain the observed Na-O, and Mg-Al anticorrelation in NGC 6752 stars by a deep mixing scenario; we think it requires some non internal mechanism.

abstract = {The current status of modeling the evolution and nucleosynthesis of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars is reviewed. The principles of AGB evolution have been investigated in recent years leading to improved and refined models, for example with regard to hot-bottom burning or the third dredge-up. The postprocessing s-process model yields quantitative results that reproduce many observations. However, these and most other processes in AGB stars are intimately related to the physics of stellar mixing. Mixing in AGB stars is currently not well-enough understood for accurate yield predictions. Several constraints and methods are available to improve the models. Some regimes of AGB evolution have not yet been studied in sufficient detail. These include the super-AGB stars and AGB stars at extremely low or ultra low metallicity.},

In this work, we demonstrate that the opposite occurs in discrete media: hidden vortex states in relatively small ring chains become unstable with the increase of the total power, while explicit vortices are stable, provided that the corresponding scalar vortex state is also stable. There are also stable mixed states, in which the components are vortices with different topological charges. Additionally, degeneracies in families of composite vortex modes lead to the existence of long-lived breather states which can exhibit vortex-charge flipping in one or both components.},

We find the spectroscopic signature of iron sulfides at 23 mu m. We also find weak features at {\textasciitilde} 34, 38 and 44 mu m. The positions of these features correspond well with the resonances of the iron sulfide troilite. However, the relative strength of the 23 mu m versus the other bands does not match the laboratory measurements, which suggests the presence of other iron sulfides besides troilite. The same broad feature around 23 mu m has been found in young stellar objects. This detection may imply a carbon star origin for part of the iron sulfides found in meteorites and interplanetary dust particles.

abstract = {The hydrogen-deficiency in extremely hot post-AGB stars of spectral class PG1159 is probably caused by a (very) late helium-shell flash or a AGB final thermal pulse that consumes the hydrogen envelope, exposing the usually-hidden intershell region. Thus, the photospheric element abundances of these stars allow us to draw conclusions about details of nuclear burning and mixing processes in the precursor AGB stars. We compare predicted element abundances to those determined by quantitative spectral analyses performed with advanced non-LTE model atmospheres. A good qualitative and quantitative agreement is found for many species (He, C, N, O, Ne, F, Si, Ar) but discrepancies for others (P, S, Fe) point at shortcomings in stellar evolution models for AGB stars. Almost all of the chemical trace elements in these hot stars can only be identified in the UV spectral range. The Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer and the Hubble Space Telescope played a crucial role for this research.},

The bulge formed from the assembly of subgalaxies at z >{\textasciitilde} 3, and has higher [$\alpha$/Fe] ratios because of the small contribution from Type Ia supernovae. The disk formed with a constant star formation over 13 Gyr, and shows a decreasing trend of [$\alpha$/Fe] and increasing trends of [(Na,Al,Cu,Mn)/Fe] against [Fe/H]. However, the thick disk stars tend to have higher [$\alpha$/Fe] and lower [Mn/Fe] than thin disk stars. We also predict the frequency distribution of elemental abundance ratios as functions of time and location, which can be directly compared with galactic archeology projects such as HERMES.},

abstract = {The chemical evolution of the Milky Way is investigated using a dual-phase metal-enriched infall model in which primordial gas fuels the earliest epoch of star formation, followed by the ongoing formation of stars from newly accreted gas. The latest metallicity distribution of local K-dwarfs is reproduced by this model, which allows the Galactic thin disk to form from slightly metal-enriched gas with $\alpha$-element enhancement. Our model predicts ages for the stellar halo and thin disk of 12.5 and 7.4Gyr respectively, in agreement with empirically determined values. The model presented in this paper is compared with a similar dual-phase infall model from Chiappini et al. (2001). We discuss a degeneracy that enables both models to recover the K-dwarf metallicity distribution while yielding different star formation histories. The metallicity distribution function (MDF) of K-dwarfs is proposed to be more directly comparable to chemical evolution model results than the G-dwarf distribution because lower mass K-dwarfs are less susceptible to stellar evolutionary effects. The K-dwarf MDF should consequently be a better probe of star formation history and provide a stronger constraint to chemical evolution models than the widely used G-dwarf MDF. The corrections that should be applied to a G-dwarf MDF are quantified for the case of the outer halo of NGC 5128.},

abstract = {We analyze stellar convection with the aid of three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamic simulations, introducing the turbulent cascade into our theoretical analysis. We devise closures of the Reynolds-decomposed mean field equations by simple physical modeling of the simulations (we relate temperature and density fluctuations via coefficients); the procedure (Convection Algorithm Based on Simulations) is terrestrially testable and is amenable to systematic improvement. We develop a turbulent kinetic energy equation which contains both nonlocal and time-dependent terms, and is appropriate if the convective transit time is shorter than the evolutionary timescale. The interpretation of mixing-length theory (MLT) as generally used in astrophysics is incorrect; MLT forces the mixing length to be an imposed constant. Direct tests show that the damping associated with the flow is that suggested by Kolmogorov (e K $\approx$ $\rho$(u')3 rms/ell D , where ell D is the size of the largest eddy and (u')rms is the local rms turbulent velocity). This eddy size is approximately the depth of the convection zone ellCZ in our simulations, and corresponds in some respects to the mixing length of MLT. New terms involving the local heating due to turbulent dissipation should appear in the stellar evolutionary equations, and are not guaranteed to be negligible. The enthalpy flux (stellar "convective luminosity") is directly connected to the buoyant acceleration, and hence to the scale of convective velocity. MLT tends to systematically underestimate the velocity scale, which affects estimates of chromospheric and coronal heating, mass loss, and wave generation. Quantitative comparison with a variety of 3D simulations reveals a previously unrecognized consistency. Extension of this approach to deal with rotational shear and MHD is indicated. Examples of application to stellar evolution will be presented in subsequent papers in this series.},

abstract = {THE primordial abundances of the light elements and their isotopes provide essential information regarding the nucleosynthetic processes that occurred in the Big Bang1,2. At present the best estimates of the baryon/photon ratio of the Universe, a fundamental cosmological parameter, are extrapolations to primordial times of light-element abundances measured in Solar System objects and in the Milky Way. Here we report a direct measurement of the 3He/4He abundance ratio in the local interstellar cloud, based on the isotopic analysis of helium atoms that have entered the Solar System from the surrounding interstellar medium. Our observations, together with the local-cloud D/H ratio3-5 and Solar System light-element data2, permit an improved estimate of the baryon/photon ratio. We find that, within present limits of error, the sum of the 3He and deuterium abundances has remained essentially unchanged since the formation of the Solar System, placing new constraints on models of Galactic chemical evolution6.},

abstract = {Context. The detection of oscillations with a mixed character in subgiants and red giants allows us to probe the physical conditions in their cores. Aims: With these mixed modes, we aim at determining seismic markers of stellar evolution. Methods: Kepler asteroseismic data were selected to map various evolutionary stages and stellar masses. Seismic evolutionary tracks were then drawn with the combination of the frequency and period spacings. Results: We measured the asymptotic period spacing for 1178 stars at various evolutionary stages. This allows us to monitor stellar evolution from the main sequence to the asymptotic giant branch and draw seismic evolutionary tracks. We present clear quantified asteroseismic definitions that characterize the change in the evolutionary stages, in particular the transition from the subgiant stage to the early red giant branch, and the end of the horizontal branch. Conclusions: The seismic information is so precise that clear conclusions can be drawn independently of evolution models. The quantitative seismic information can now be used for stellar modeling, especially for studying the energy transport in the helium-burning core or for specifying the inner properties of stars entering the red or asymptotic giant branches. Modeling will also allow us to study stars that are identified to be in the helium-subflash stage, high-mass stars either arriving or quitting the secondary clump, or stars that could be in the blue-loop stage.

abstract = {There is observational evidence that supports the existence of very massive stars (VMS) in the local universe. First, VMS (Mini ≲ 320 M⊙) have been observed in the Large Magellanic Clouds (LMC). Secondly, there are observed supernovae (SNe) that bear the characteristics of pair creation supernovae (PCSNe, also referred to as pair instability SN) which have VMS as progenitors. The most promising candidate to date is SN 2007bi. In order to investigate the evolution and fate of nearby VMS, we calculated a new grid of models for such objects, for solar, LMC and Small Magellanic Clouds (SMC) metallicities, which covers the initial mass range from 120 to 500 M⊙. Both rotating and non-rotating models were calculated using the GENEVA stellar evolution code and evolved until at least the end of helium burning and for most models until oxygen burning. Since VMS have very large convective cores during the main-sequence phase, their evolution is not so much affected by rotational mixing, but more by mass loss through stellar winds. Their evolution is never far from a homogeneous evolution even without rotational mixing. All the VMS, at all the metallicities studied here, end their life as WC(WO)-type Wolf-Rayet stars. Because of very important mass losses through stellar winds, these stars may have luminosities during the advanced phases of their evolution similar to stars with initial masses between 60 and 120 M⊙. A distinctive feature which may be used to disentangle Wolf-Rayet stars originating from VMS from those originating from lower initial masses would be the enhanced abundances of Ne and Mg at the surface of WC stars. This feature is however not always apparent depending on the history of mass loss. At solar metallicity, none of our models is expected to explode as a PCSN. At the metallicity of the LMC, only stars more massive than 300 M⊙ are expected to explode as PCSNe. At the SMC metallicity, the mass range for the PCSN progenitors is much larger and comprises stars with initial masses between about 100 and 290 M⊙. All VMS in the metallicity range studied here produce either a Type Ib SN or a Type Ic SN but not a Type II SN. We estimate that the progenitor of SN 2007bi, assuming a SMC metallicity, had an initial mass between 160 and 175 M⊙. None of models presented in this grid produces gamma-ray bursts or magnetars. They lose too much angular momentum by mass loss or avoid the formation of a black hole by producing a completely disruptive PCSN.},

abstract = {The reexamination of astrophysical opacities has eliminated gross discrepancies between a variety of observations and theoretical calculations; thus allowing for more detailed tests of stellar models. A number of such studies indicate that model results are sensitive to modest changes in the opacity. Consequently, it is desirable to update available opacity databases with recent improvements in physics, refinements of element abundance, and other such factors affecting the results. Updated OPAL Rosseland mean opacities are presented. The new results have incorporated improvements in the physics and numerical procedures as well as corrections. The main opacity changes are increases of as much as 20% for Population I stars due to the explicit inclusion of 19 metals (compared to 12 metals in the earlier calculations) with the other modifications introducing opacity changes smaller than 10%. In addition, the temperature and density range covered by the updated opacity tables has been extended. As before, the tables allow accurate interpolation in density and temperature as well as hydrogen, helium, carbon, oxygen, and metal mass fractions. Although a specific metal composition is emphasized, opacity tables for different metal distributions can be made readily available. The updated opacities are compared to other work.},

abstract = {We report the identification of the double-degenerate system NLTT 16249 that comprises a normal, hydrogen-rich (DA) white dwarf and a peculiar, carbon-polluted white dwarf (DQ) showing photospheric traces of nitrogen. We disentangled the observed spectra and constrained the properties of both stellar components. In the evolutionary scenario commonly applied to the sequence of DQ white dwarfs, both carbon and nitrogen would be dredged up from the core. The C/N abundance ratio ($\approx$50) in the atmosphere of this unique DQ white dwarf suggests the presence of unprocessed material (14N) in the core or in the envelope. Helium burning in the DQ progenitor may have terminated early on the red giant branch after a mass-ejection event leaving unprocessed material in the core, although current mass estimates do not favor the presence of a low-mass helium core. Alternatively, some nitrogen in the envelope may have survived an abridged helium-core burning phase prior to climbing the asymptotic giant branch. Based on available data, we estimate a relatively short orbital period (P <{\textasciitilde} 13 hr) and ongoing spectroscopic observations will help determine precise orbital parameters.

abstract = {The asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase is the final stage of nuclear burning for low-mass stars. Although Milky Way globular clusters are now known to harbour (at least) two generations of stars, they still provide relatively homogeneous samples of stars that are used to constrain stellar evolution theory. It is predicted by stellar models that the majority of cluster stars with masses around the current turn-off mass (that is, the mass of the stars that are currently leaving the main sequence phase) will evolve through the AGB phase. Here we report that all of the second-generation stars in the globular cluster NGC 6752--70 per cent of the cluster population--fail to reach the AGB phase. Through spectroscopic abundance measurements, we found that every AGB star in our sample has a low sodium abundance, indicating that they are exclusively first-generation stars. This implies that many clusters cannot reliably be used for star counts to test stellar evolution timescales if the AGB population is included. We have no clear explanation for this observation.},

abstract = {We describe a general radiative equilibrium and temperature correction procedure for use in Monte Carlo radiation transfer codes with sources of temperature-independent opacity, such as astrophysical dust. The technique utilizes the fact that Monte Carlo simulations track individual photon packets, so we may easily determine where their energy is absorbed. When a packet is absorbed, it heats a particular cell within the envelope, raising its temperature. To enforce radiative equilibrium, the absorbed packet is immediately reemitted. To correct the cell temperature, the frequency of the reemitted packet is chosen so that it corrects the temperature of the spectrum previously emitted by the cell. The reemitted packet then continues being scattered, absorbed, and reemitted until it finally escapes from the envelope. As the simulation runs, the envelope heats up, and the emergent spectral energy distribution (SED) relaxes to its equilibrium value without iteration. This implies that the equilibrium temperature calculation requires no more computation time than the SED calculation of an equivalent pure scattering model with fixed temperature. In addition to avoiding iteration, our method conserves energy exactly because all injected photon packets eventually escape. Furthermore, individual packets transport energy across the entire system because they are never destroyed. This long-range communication, coupled with the lack of iteration, implies that our method does not suffer the convergence problems commonly associated with $\Lambda$-iteration. To verify our temperature correction procedure, we compare our results with standard benchmark tests, and finally we present the results of simulations for two-dimensional axisymmetric density structures.},

abstract = {To check the impact of the multiple population scenario for globular clusters on their horizontal branch (HB), we present an analysis of the composition of 110 red HB (RHB) stars in 47 Tucanae and of 61 blue HB (BHB) and 30 RHB stars in M 5. In 47 Tuc we found tight relations between the colours of the stars and their abundances of p-capture elements. This strongly supports the idea that the He content - which is expected to be closely correlated with the abundances of p-capture elements - is the third parameter (after overall metallicity and age) that determines the colour of HB stars. However, the range in He abundance must be small ($\Delta$Y < 0.03) in 47 Tuc to reproduce our observations; this agrees with previous analyses. There is possibly a correlation between the abundances of p- and n-capture elements in 47 Tuc. If confirmed, this might suggest that asymptotic giant branch stars of moderate mass contributed to the gas from which second-generation stars formed. Considering the selection effects in our sample (which does not include stars warmer than 11 000 K and RR Lyrae variables, which were excluded because we could not obtain accurate abundances with the adopted observing procedure) is important to understand our results for M 5. In this case, we find that, as expected, RHB stars are Na-poor and O-rich, and likely belong to the primordial population. There is a clear correlation of the [Na/O] ratio and N abundance with colour along the BHB. A derivation of the He abundance for these stars yields a low value of Y = 0.22 {\textpm} 0.03. This is expected because HB stars of a putative He-rich population in this cluster should be warmer than 11 000 K, and would accordingly not have been sampled by our analysis. However, we need some additional source of scatter in the total mass loss of stars climbing up the red giant branch to reproduce our results for M 5. Finally, we found a C-star on the HB of 47 Tuc and a Ba-rich, fast-rotating, likely binary star on the HB of M 5. These stars are among the brightest and coolest HB stars.

We modify the physics of a standard stellar evolution code in order to determine what does and what does not contribute to a star becoming a red giant. In particular, we have run tests to try to separate the effects of changes in the mean molecular weight and in the energy generation. The implications for why stars become red giants are discussed. We find that while a change in the mean molecular weight is necessary (but not sufficient) for a 1-Msolar star to become a red giant, this is not the case in a star of 5 Msolar. It therefore seems that there may be more than one way to make a giant.},

The central opacity and flux decreases give the convective region a strong tendency to shrink.},

abstract = {We study the two-point correlation function of a uniformly selected sample of 4426 luminous optical quasars with redshift 2.9<=z<=5.4 selected over 4041 deg2 from the Fifth Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We fit a power-law to the projected correlation function wp(rp) to marginalize over redshift-space distortions and redshift errors. For a real-space correlation function of the form $\xi$(r)=(r/r0)-$\gamma$, the fitted parameters in comoving coordinates are r0=15.2+/-2.7 h-1 Mpc and $\gamma$=2.0+/-0.3, over a scale range 4 h-1 Mpc<=rp<=150 h-1 Mpc. Thus high-redshift quasars are appreciably more strongly clustered than their z{\textasciitilde}1.5 counterparts, which have a comoving clustering length r0{\textasciitilde}6.5 h-1 Mpc. Dividing our sample into two redshift bins, 2.9<=z<=3.5 and z>=3.5, and assuming a power-law index $\gamma$=2.0, we find a correlation length of r0=16.9+/-1.7 h-1 Mpc for the former and r0=24.3+/-2.4 h-1 Mpc for the latter. Strong clustering at high redshift indicates that quasars are found in very massive, and therefore highly biased, halos. Following Martini {\&} Weinberg, we relate the clustering strength and quasar number density to the quasar lifetimes and duty cycle. Using the Sheth {\&} Tormen halo mass function, the quasar lifetime is estimated to lie in the range {\textasciitilde}4-50 Myr for quasars with 2.9<=z<=3.5, and {\textasciitilde}30-600 Myr for quasars with z>=3.5. The corresponding duty cycles are {\textasciitilde}0.004-0.05 for the lower redshift bin and {\textasciitilde}0.03-0.6 for the higher redshift bin. The minimum mass of halos in which these quasars reside is (2-3){\texttimes}1012 h-1 Msolar for quasars with 2.9<=z<=3.5 and (4-6){\texttimes}1012 h-1 Msolar for quasars with z>=3.5 the effective bias factor beff increases with redshift, e.g., beff{\textasciitilde}8 at z=3.0 and beff{\textasciitilde}16 at z=4.5.},

abstract = {50% of the heavy element abundances are produced via slow neutron capture reactions in different stellar scenarios. The underlying nucleosynthesis models need the input of neutron capture cross sections. One of the fundamental signatures for active nucleosynthesis in our galaxy is the observation of long-lived radioactive isotopes, such as $^{60}$Fe with a half-life of $2.60\times10^6$ yr. To reproduce this $\gamma$-activity in the universe, the nucleosynthesis of $^{60}$Fe has to be understood reliably. A $^{60}$Fe sample produced at the Paul-Scherrer-Institut was activated with thermal and epithermal neutrons at the research reactor at the Johannes Gutenberg-Universit\"at Mainz. The thermal neutron capture cross section has been measured for the first time to $\sigma_{\text{th}}=0.226 \ (^{+0.044}_{-0.049})$ b. An upper limit of $\sigma_{\text{RI}} < 0.50$ b could be determined for the resonance integral. An extrapolation towards the astrophysicaly interesting energy regime between $kT$=10 keV and 100 keV illustrates that the s-wave part of the direct capture component can be neglected.},

For each chemical composition, we constructed a grid of fundamental and first overtone models covering a broad range of stellar masses and luminosities. To constrain the impact of the helium content on RR Lyrae properties, we adopted two observables{\textemdash}period distribution and luminosity amplitudes{\textemdash}that are independent of distance and reddening. The current predictions confirm that the helium content has a marginal effect on the pulsation properties. The key parameter causing the difference between canonical and He-enhanced observables is the luminosity. We compared current predictions with the sample of 189 RR Lyrae stars in $\omega$ Cen and found that the period range of He-enhanced models is systematically longer than observed. These findings apply to metal-poor and metal-intermediate He-enhanced models. To further constrain the impact of He-enhanced structures on the period distribution, we also computed a series of synthetic horizontal branch (HB) models and found that the predicted period distribution, based on a Gaussian sampling in mass, agrees quite well with observations. This applies not only to the minimum fundamentalized period of RR Lyrae stars (0.39 versus 0.34 days) but also to the fraction of Type II Cepheids (2% versus 3%). We also computed a series of synthetic HB models assuming a mixed HB population in which the 80% is made of canonical HB structures, while the 20% is made of He-enhanced (Y = 0.30) HB structures. We found that the fraction of Type II Cepheids predicted by these models is almost a factor of two larger than observed (5% versus 3%). This indicates that the fraction of He-enhanced structures in $\omega$ Cen cannot be larger than 20%.},

abstract = {Evidence from high-resolution spectra is presented for star-to-star variations of an order of magnitude in the sodium abundances of red-giant members of the globular cluster M13. It is shown that the large enhancement of the weak 2.10 eV Na I lines at 5682 and 5688 A which is observed in II-67 with respect to II-76 cannot have been misinterpreted because of errors in the model-atmosphere abundance analysis. Except for oxygen (and/or carbon), no other element observed gives evidence for abundance variations from star to star. Since sodium is theoretically difficult to synthesize during giant-branch evolution, the abundance differences must reflect pre-existing variations in the protocluster gas in which the overall metallicity level was preserved.},

abstract = {We present an empirical method that uses multicolor light-curve shapes (MLCSs) to estimate the luminosity, distance, and total line-of-sight extinction of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). The empirical correlation between the MLCSs and the luminosity is derived from a "training set" of nine SN Ia light curves with independent distance and reddening estimates. We find that intrinsically dim SN Ia's are redder and have faster light curves than the bright ones, which are slow and blue. By 35 days after maximum, the intrinsic color variations become negligible. A formal treatment of extinction employing Bayes's theorem is used to estimate the best value and its uncertainty. Applying the MLCS method to both light curves and to color curves provides enough information to determine which supernovae are dim because they are distant, which are intrinsically dim, and which are dim because of extinction by dust. The precision of the MLCS distances is examined by constructing a Hubble diagram with an independent set of 20 SN Ia's. The dispersion of 0.12 mag indicates a typical distance accuracy of 5% for a single object, and the intercept yields a Hubble constant on the Sandage et al. Cepheid distance scale of H_0_ = 64 +/- 3 (statistical) km s^-1^ Mpc^-1^ (+/-6 total error). The slope of 0.2010 +/- 0.0035 mag over the distance interval 32.2 < $\mu$ < 38.3 yields the most precise confirmation of the linearity of the Hubble law.},

abstract = {The rotation of horizontal-branch stars places important constraints on angular momentum evolution in evolved stars and therefore on rotational mixing on the giant branch. Prompted by new observations of rotation rates of horizontal-branch stars, we calculate simple models for the angular momentum evolution of a globular cluster giant star from the base of the giant branch to the star's appearance on the horizontal branch. We include mass loss and infer the accompanied loss of angular momentum for each of four assumptions about the internal angular momentum profile. Mass loss is found to have important implications for angular momentum evolution. These models are compared to observations of horizontal-branch rotation rates in M13. We find that rapid rotation on the horizontal branch can be reconciled with slow solid body main-sequence rotation if giant-branch stars have differential rotation in their convective envelopes and a rapidly rotating core, which is then followed by a redistribution of angular momentum on the horizontal branch. We discuss the physical reasons that these very different properties relative to the solar case may exist in giants. Rapid rotation in the core of the main-sequence precursors of the rapidly rotating horizontal-branch star or an angular momentum source on the giant branch is required for all cases if the rotational velocity of turnoff stars is less than 4 km s-1. We suggest that the observed range in rotation rates on the horizontal branch is caused by internal angular momentum redistribution, which occurs on a timescale comparable to the evolution of the stars on the horizontal branch. The apparent lack of rapid horizontal-branch rotators hotter than 12,000 K in M13 could be a consequence of gravitational settling, which inhibits internal angular momentum transport. Alternative explanations and observational tests are discussed.},

abstract = {We report on the masses, sizes, and orbits of the planets orbiting 22 Kepler stars. There are 49 planet candidates around these stars, including 42 detected through transits and 7 revealed by precise Doppler measurements of the host stars. Based on an analysis of the Kepler brightness measurements, along with high-resolution imaging and spectroscopy, Doppler spectroscopy, and (for 11 stars) asteroseismology, we establish low false-positive probabilities (FPPs) for all of the transiting planets (41 of 42 have an FPP under 1%), and we constrain their sizes and masses. Most of the transiting planets are smaller than three times the size of Earth. For 16 planets, the Doppler signal was securely detected, providing a direct measurement of the planet's mass. For the other 26 planets we provide either marginal mass measurements or upper limits to their masses and densities; in many cases we can rule out a rocky composition. We identify six planets with densities above 5 g cm-3, suggesting a mostly rocky interior for them. Indeed, the only planets that are compatible with a purely rocky composition are smaller than {\textasciitilde}2 R ⊕. Larger planets evidently contain a larger fraction of low-density material (H, He, and H2O). Based in part on observations obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated by the University of California and the California Institute of Technology.},

The initial-final mass relation is examined for our stars and found to fit to within 0.1 Msolar of the observations.

We review how well current stellar evolution models reproduce the properties of simple stellar populations. Emphasis is given to the regions of the color-magnitude diagram which are most useful for deriving age, metallicity, or distance of a population. Extensive comparison is made between the predictions of the most-used stellar evolution libraries, in order to estimate how model dependent the results are. The present review, written from a user perspective, aims at emphasizing the strengths and weaknesses of the models, and is intended both for observers and theoreticians.

abstract = {In order to assess qualitatively the ejecta geometry of stripped-envelope core-collapse supernovae (SNe), we investigate 98 late-time spectra of 39 objects, many of them previously unpublished. We perform a Gauss-fitting of the [OI] $\lambda$$\lambda$6300, 6364 feature in all spectra, with the position, full width at half maximum and intensity of the $\lambda$6300 Gaussian as free parameters, and the $\lambda$6364 Gaussian added appropriately to account for the doublet nature of the [OI] feature. On the basis of the best-fitting parameters, the objects are organized into morphological classes, and we conclude that at least half of all Type Ib/c SNe must be aspherical. Bipolar jet models do not seem to be universally applicable, as we find too few symmetric double-peaked [OI] profiles. In some objects, the [OI] line exhibits a variety of shifted secondary peaks or shoulders, interpreted as blobs of matter ejected at high velocity and possibly accompanied by neutron-star kicks to assure momentum conservation. At phases earlier than {\textasciitilde}200d, a systematic blueshift of the [OI] $\lambda$$\lambda$6300, 6364 line centroids can be discerned. Residual opacity provides the most convincing explanation of this phenomenon, photons emitted on the rear side of the SN being scattered or absorbed on their way through the ejecta. Once modified to account for the doublet nature of the oxygen feature, the profile of MgI] $\lambda$4571 at sufficiently late phases generally resembles that of [OI] $\lambda$$\lambda$6300, 6364, suggesting negligible contamination from other lines and confirming that O and Mg are similarly distributed within the ejecta.},

abstract = {Globular cluster stars show chemical abundance patterns typical of hot-CNO processing, and photometric evidence for the presence of multiple populations. Lithium is easily destroyed by proton capture in stellar environments, so determining its abundance may be crucial to discriminate among different models proposed to account for the origin of the gas from which the multiple populations form. In order to reproduce the observed O-Na anticorrelation and other patterns typical of multiple populations, the formation of second-generation stars must occur from the nuclearly processed stellar ejecta, responsible for the chemical anomalies, diluted with pristine gas having the composition of first-generation stars. This gas is a remnant of the first phases of star formation, or it has been re-accreted on the cluster core after the end of the Type II supernova explosions. As a consequence, the lithium abundance in the unprocessed gas - which is very likely to be equal to the lithium abundance emerging from the big bang - affects the lithium chemical patterns among the cluster stars. This paper focuses on a scenario in which processed gas is provided by asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. We examine the predictions of this scenario for the lithium abundances of multiple populations. We study the role of the non-negligible lithium abundance in the ejecta of massive AGB stars [A( Li ){\~{ }}2], and, at the same time, we explore how our models can constrain the extremely large - and very model dependent - lithium yields predicted by recent super-AGB models. We show that the super-AGB yields may be tested by examining the lithium abundances in a large set of blue main-sequence stars in $\omega$ Cen and/or NGC 2808. In addition, we examine the different model results obtained by assuming for the pristine gas either the big bang abundance predicted by the standard models [A( Li )=2.6-2.7] or the abundance detected at the surface of Population II stars [A( Li )=2.2-2.3], and we show that, once a chemical model is well constrained by a comparison with the observations, the O-Li distribution could perhaps be used to shed light on the primordial lithium abundance.},

abstract = {The nearby supernova SN 2011fe can be observed in unprecedented detail. Therefore, it is an important test case for Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) models, which may bring us closer to understanding the physical nature of these objects. Here, we explore how available and expected future observations of SN 2011fe can be used to constrain SN Ia explosion scenarios. We base our discussion on three-dimensional simulations of a delayed detonation in a Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf and of a violent merger of two white dwarfs (WDs){\textemdash}realizations of explosion models appropriate for two of the most widely discussed progenitor channels that may give rise to SNe Ia. Although both models have their shortcomings in reproducing details of the early and near-maximum spectra of SN 2011fe obtained by the Nearby Supernova Factory (SNfactory), the overall match with the observations is reasonable. The level of agreement is slightly better for the merger, in particular around maximum, but a clear preference for one model over the other is still not justified. Observations at late epochs, however, hold promise for discriminating the explosion scenarios in a straightforward way, as a nucleosynthesis effect leads to differences in the 55Co production. SN 2011fe is close enough to be followed sufficiently long to study this effect.},

abstract = {High resolution spectra (R $\ge$40 000) for 9 main sequence turn-off stars and 9 subgiants in the globular cluster NGC 6752 were acquired with UVES on the VLT-Kueyen (UT2). These data have been used to determine the abundances of some heavy elements (strontium, yttrium, barium and europium). This paper presents for the first time accurate results for heavy elements in this globular cluster. We did not find any systematic effect between the abundances found in turn-off stars, subgiants, and giants. We obtain the following mean abundances for these elements in our sample (turn-off stars and subgiants): [Sr/Fe] = 0.06 {\textpm} 0.16, [Y/Fe] = -0.01 {\textpm} 0.12, [Ba/Fe] = 0.18 {\textpm} 0.11, and [Eu/Fe] = 0.41 {\textpm} 0.09. The dispersion in the abundance ratios of the different elements is low and can be totally explained by uncertainties in their derivation. These ratios are in agreement with the values found in field halo stars with the same metallicity. We did not observe any correlation between the [n-capture/Fe] ratios and the star-to-star variations of the O and Na abundances. The [Ba/Eu] and [Sr/Ba] ratios show clearly that this globular cluster has also been uniformly enriched by r- and s-process synthesis.

abstract = {We present a detailed comparison of an extended set of elemental abundances observed in some of the most metal poor stars presently known and the ejecta produced by a generation of primordial core collapse supernovae. At variance with most of the analysis performed up to now (in which mainly the global trends with the overall metallicity are discussed), we think that it is important (and complementary to the other approach) to fit the (available) chemical composition of specific stars. In particular, we first discuss the differences among the five stars that form our initial database and define a ``template'' ultra-metal-poor star that is then compared to the theoretical predictions. Our main findings are the following: (1) The fit to [Si/Mg] and [Ca/Mg] of these very metal-poor stars seems to favor the presence of a rather large C abundance at the end of the central He burning; in a classical scenario in which the border of the convective core is strictly determined by the Schwarzschild criterion, such a large C abundance would imply a rather low 12C($\alpha$,$\gamma$)16O reaction rate. (2) A low C abundance left by the central He burning would imply a low [Al/Mg] (<-1.2 dex) independently on the initial mass of the exploding star, while a rather large C abundance would produce such a low [Al/Mg] only for the most massive stellar model. (3) At variance with current beliefs that it is difficult to interpret the observed overabundance of [Co/Fe], we find that a mildly large C abundance in the He exhausted core (well within the present range of uncertainty) easily and naturally allows a very good fit to [Co/Fe]. (4) Our yields allow a reasonable fit to eight of the 11 available elemental abundances. (5) Within the present grid of models it is not possible to find a good match of the remaining three elements, Ti, Cr, and Ni (even for an arbitrary choice of the mass cut). (6) The adoption of other yields available in the literature does not improve the fit. (7) Since no mass in our grid provides a satisfactory fit to these three elements, even an arbitrary choice of the initial mass function would not improve their fit.},

abstract = {Aims: We examine the interactions of various instabilities in rotating stars, which usually are considered as independent. Methods: An analytical study of the problem is performed accounting for radiative losses, $\mu$-gradients, and horizontal turbulence. Results: The diffusion coefficient for an ensemble of instabilities is not given by the sum of the specific coefficients for each instability, but by the solution of a general equation. We find that thermohaline mixing is possible in low-mass red giants only if the horizontal turbulence is very weak. In rotating stars the Rayleigh-Taylor and the shear instabilities need simultaneous treating. This leads to rotation laws of the form 1/r$\alpha$ being predicted to be unstable for $\alpha$ > 1.6568, while the usual Rayleigh criterion only predicts instability for $\alpha$ > 2. Also, the shear instabilities are somehow reduced in main sequence stars by the effect of the Rayleigh-Taylor criterion. Various instability criteria should be expressed differently in rotating stars than in simplified geometries.},

abstract = {We present spectroscopic abundances and radial velocities for giant stars in the Galactic globular cluster $\omega$ Centauri based on the Ca II infrared triplet. Two samples of stars were observed: 234 stars at Mv{\~{ }}1.25 on the lower giant branch at radial distances between 8' and 23', and 145 stars at Mv{\~{ }}-1.3 at radial distances between 3' and 22'. We found 199 and 144 radial velocity members, respectively, in the two samples. These samples were corrected for evolutionary effects to provide an unbiased distribution of the underlying stellar metallicity. We find <vr>=234.7{\textpm}1.3 $\sigma$obs=11.3 km s-1 (bright sample), and (Vr=232.9{\textpm}1.2, $\sigma$obs=10.6 km s-1 (faint sample). The statistical errors of the dispersions are less than 1 km s-1. Previous metallicity studies found a non-Gaussian metallicity distribution containing a tail of metal-rich stars. We confirm these results except our unbiased cluster metallicity distributions are narrower. They contain the following key features: (1) No very metal-poor stars, (2) a sudden rise in the metal-poor distribution to a modal [Fe/H] value of - 1.70 consistent with an homogeneous metallicity unresolved at the 0.07 dex level, (3) a tail to higher metallicities with more stars than predicted by simple chemical evolution models, and (4) a weak correlation between metallicity and radius such that the most metal-rich stars are concentrated to the cluster core. The unresolved metal-weak tail implies that the gas out of which $\omega$ Cen formed was well-mixed up to the modal metallicity of the cluster. Therefore, $\omega$ Cen like other Galactic globular clusters, seems to have formed in a pre-enriched and homogenized (up to the modal metallicity) environment. The existence of a weak metallicity gradient supports the idea that co Cen self-enriched, with the enriched gas sinking to the cluster center due to gas dissipation processes. We also note, however, that the metal-rich stars are more massive than the bulk of the stars in the cluster, and could also have sunk to the center by dynamical mass segregation over the lifetime of the cluster.},

Fitting to these modes gives the large and small frequency separations as a function of frequency. The mode lifetime, as measured from the scatter of the oscillation frequencies about a smooth trend, is similar to that in the Sun. Limited observations of the star $\delta$ Pav show oscillations centered at 2.3 mHz, with peak amplitudes close to solar. We introduce a new method of measuring oscillation amplitudes from heavily smoothed power density spectra, from which we estimated amplitudes for $\alpha$ Cen $\alpha$ and B, $\beta$ Hyi, $\delta$ Pav, and the Sun. We point out that the oscillation amplitudes may depend on which spectral lines are used for the velocity measurements.

abstract = {Recent observational studies of $\omega$ Centauri by the Hubble Space Telescope have discovered a double main sequence in the color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of its stellar populations. These observations suggest that the stellar population with the blue main sequence (bMS) has a helium abundance much larger, by $\Delta$Y{\textasciitilde}0.12, than that of the red main sequence (rMS). By using somewhat idealized models in which stars of the bMS are formed from gas ejected from stars of the rMS, we quantitatively investigate whether the helium overabundance of the bMS can result from self-enrichment from massive AGB stars, from mass loss of very massive young stars, or from Type II supernovae within $\omega$ Cen. We show that as long as the helium enrichment is due to ejecta from the rMS formed earlier than the bMS, none of these three enrichment scenarios can explain the observed properties of the bMS self-consistently for reasonable IMFs. The common, serious problem in all cases is that the observed number fraction of the bMS cannot be explained without assuming unusually top-heavy IMFs. This failure of the self-enrichment scenarios implies that most of the helium-enriched gas necessary for the formation of the bMS originated from other external sources. We thus suggest a new scenario, in which most of the second generation of stars (i.e., the bMS) in $\omega$ Cen could have formed from gas ejected from field stellar populations that surrounded $\omega$ Cen when it was the nucleus of an ancient dwarf galaxy.},

abstract = {In this paper, we analyze the effects induced by rotation on low-mass asymptotic giant branch stars. We compute two sets of models, M = 2.0 M ⊙ at [Fe/H] = 0 and M = 1.5 M ⊙ at [Fe/H] = -1.7, by adopting main-sequence rotation velocities in the range 0-120 km s-1. At high metallicity, we find that the Goldreich-Schubert-Fricke instability, active at the interface between the convective envelope and the rapid rotating core, contaminates the 13C-pocket (the major neutron source) with 14N (the major neutron poison), thus reducing the neutron flux available for the synthesis of heavy elements. As a consequence, the yields of heavy-s elements (Ba, La, Nd, Sm) and, to a lesser extent, those of light-s elements (Sr, Y, Zr) decrease with increasing rotation velocities up to 60 km s-1. However, for larger initial rotation velocities, the production of light-s and, to a lesser extent, that of heavy-s, begins again to increase, due to mixing induced by meridional circulations. At low metallicity, the effects of meridional circulations are important even at rather low rotation velocity. The combined effect of the Goldreich-Schubert-Fricke instability and meridional circulations determines an increase of light-s and, to a lesser extent, heavy-s elements, while lead is strongly reduced. For both metallicities, the rotation-induced instabilities active during the interpulse phase reduce the neutron-to-seed ratio, so that the spectroscopic indexes [hs/ls] and [Pb/hs] decrease by increasing the initial rotation velocity. Our analysis suggests that rotation could explain the spread in the s-process indexes, as observed in s-process enriched stars at different metallicities.},

We calculate evolutionary sequences with the primordial helium abundance (Y = 0.24) and with helium-enriched compositions (Y = 0.30, 0.35, 0.40). For comparison, we calculate models of the same mass but at a lower metallicity Z = 0.0003 ([Fe/H] $\approx${\textendash}1.8) with Y = 0.24. Post-processing nucleosynthesis calculations are performed on each of the evolutionary sequences to determine the production of elements from hydrogen to bismuth. Elemental surface abundance predictions and stellar yields are presented for each model. The models with enriched helium have shorter main sequence and AGB lifetimes, and they enter the AGB with a more massive hydrogen-exhausted core than the primordial helium model. The main consequences are as follows: (1) low-mass AGB models with enhanced helium will evolve more than twice as fast, giving them the chance to contribute sooner to the chemical evolution of the forming globular clusters, and (2) the stellar yields will be strongly reduced relative to their primordial helium counterparts. An increase of $\Delta$Y = 0.10 at a given mass decreases the yields of carbon by up to $\approx$60% and of fluorine by up to 80%; it also decreases the yields of the s-process elements barium and lanthanum by $\approx$45%. While the yields of first s-process peak elements strontium, yttrium, and zirconium decrease by up to 50%, the yields of rubidium either do not change or increase.},

After demonstrating that the chemical features of $\omega$Cen cannot be reproduced in the framework of the closed-box self-enrichment scenario, we discuss a model in which this cluster is the remnant of a dwarf spheroidal galaxy evolved in isolation and then swallowed by the Milky Way. Both infall of primordial matter and metal-enriched gas outflows have to be considered in order to reproduce the stellar metallicity distribution function, the age-metallicity relation and several abundance ratios. Yet, as long as an ordinary stellar mass function and standard stellar yields are assumed, we fail by far to get the enormous helium enhancement required to explain the blue main sequence (and, perhaps, the extreme horizontal branch) stellar data. Rotating models of massive stars producing stellar winds with large helium excesses at low metallicities have been put forward as promising candidates to solve the `helium enigma' of $\omega$Cen. However, we show that for any reasonable choice of the initial mass function the helium-to-metal enrichment of the integrated stellar population is unavoidably much lower than 70 and conclude that the issue of the helium enhancement in $\omega$Cen still waits for a satisfactory explanation. We briefly speculate upon possible solutions.},

abstract = {Nuclear transformations giving rise to the production of the p-process (bypassed) elements are examined within the framework established by explosive nucleosynthesis studies. The guiding assumption is that thermonuclear processes occurring in hydrogen-rich matter in supernova envelopes following the passage of a shock wave are responsible for the formation of these nuclei. It is demonstrated that there exists a restrictive range of temperature-density conditions for which the enhanced production of most of the p-process nuclei occurs in relative concentrations consistent with solar system abundances. The implications of these results for galactic nucleosynthesis are discussed.-},

abstract = {Period--luminosity (PL) relations of variable red giants in the Large (LMC) and Small Magellanic Clouds (SMC) are presented. The PL diagrams are plotted in three planes: log P-K_S, log P-W_JK, and log P-W_I, where W_JK and W_I are reddening free Wesenheit indices. Fourteen PL sequences are distinguishable, and some of them consist of three closely spaced ridges. Each of the sequences is fitted with a linear or quadratic function. The similarities and differences between the PL relations in both galaxies are discussed for four types of red giant variability: OGLE Small Amplitude Red Giants (OSARGs), Miras and Semiregular Variables (SRVs), Long Secondary Periods (LSPs) and ellipsoidal variables. We propose a new method of separating OSARGs from non-variable stars and SRVs. The method employs the position in the reddening-free PL diagrams and the characteristic period ratios of these multiperiodic variables. The PL relations for the LMC OSARG are compared with the calculated relations for RGB models along isochrones of relevant ages and metallicities. We also compare measured periods and amplitudes of the OSARGs with predictions based on the relations valid for less luminous solar-like pulsators. Miras and SRVs seem to follow PL relation of the same slopes in the LMC and SMC, while for LSP and ellipsoidal variables slopes in both galaxies are different. The PL sequences defined by LSP variables and binary systems overlap in the whole range of analyzed wavebands. We put forward new arguments for the binary star scenario as an explanation of the LSP variability and elaborate on it further. The measured pulsation to orbital period ratio implies nearly constant ratio of the star radius to orbital distance, R/A approx 0.4, as we find. Combined effect of tidal friction and mass loss enhanced by the low-mass companion may explain why such a value is preferred.},

abstract = {We examine the correlation between the star formation rate (SFR) and black hole accretion rate (BHAR) across a suite of different active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback models, using the time evolution of a merger simulation. By considering three different stages of evolution, and a distinction between the nuclear and outer regions of star formation, we consider 63 different cases. Despite many of the feedback models fitting the M-$\sigma$ relationship well, there are often distinct differences in the SFR-BHAR correlations, with close to linear trends only being present after the merger. Some of the models also show evolution in the SFR-BHAR parameter space that is at times directly across the long-term averaged SFR-BHAR correlation. This suggests that the observational SFR-BHAR correlation found for ensembles of galaxies is an approximate statistical trend, as suggested by Hickox et al. Decomposing the SFR into nuclear and outer components also highlights notable differences between models and there is only modest agreement with observational studies examining this in Seyfert galaxies. For the fraction of the black hole mass growth from the merger event relative to the final black hole mass, we find as much as a factor of 3 variation among models. This also translates into a similar variation in the post-starburst black hole mass growth. Overall, we find that while qualitative features are often similar amongst models, precise quantitative analysis shows there can be quite distinct differences.},

abstract = {Very deep images of the Galactic globular cluster M 4 (NGC 6121) through the F606W and F814W filters were taken in 2001 with the WFPC2 on board the HST. A first published analysis of this data set (Richer et al. \cite{Richer2002}) produced the result that the age of M 4 is 12.7{\textpm} 0.7 Gyr (Hansen et al. \cite{Hansen2002}), thus setting a robust lower limit to the age of the universe. In view of the great astronomical importance of getting this number right, we have subjected the same data set to the simplest possible photometric analysis that completely avoids uncertain assumptions about the origin of the detected sources. This analysis clearly reveals both a thin main sequence, from which can be deduced the deepest statistically complete mass function yet determined for a globular cluster, and a white dwarf (WD) sequence extending all the way down to the 5 \sigma detection limit at I ≃ 27. The WD sequence is abruptly terminated at exactly this limit as expected by detection statistics. Using our most recent theoretical WD models (Prada Moroni {\&} Straniero \cite{Prada2002}) to obtain the expected WD sequence for different ages in the observed bandpasses, we find that the data so far obtained do not reach the peak of the WD luminosity function, thus only allowing one to set a lower limit to the age of M 4 of {\~{ }}9 Gyr. Thus, the problem of determining the absolute age of a globular cluster and, therefore, the onset of GC formation with cosmologically significant accuracy remains completely open. Only observations several magnitudes deeper than the limit obtained so far would allow one to approach this objective. Based on observations with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by AURA for NASA under contract NAS5-26555.},

abstract = {The thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch (TP-AGB) is a computationally demanding phase of evolution. This work presents a set of models that have been computed fully simultaneously - i.e. by solving the equations of stellar structure, nuclear burning and mixing together for each iteration of each timestep. It details the development of a viscous mesh technique in order to deal with some of the numerical problems that occur during the TP-AGB. Models have been created at solar metallicity (Z = 0.02) and metallicities appropriate to the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (Z = 0.008 and Z = 0.004). These are evolved without mass loss. The solar metallicity models display important differences from those computed using other codes including deeper third dredge-up. The Large and Small Magellanic Cloud models are used to investigate the problem of the carbon star luminosity function. TP-AGB stars are also important sites for stellar nucleosynthesis. In order to investigate nucleosynthesis on the TP-AGB a set of subroutines have been developed to track the evolution of isotopes from deuterium to sulphur plus important iron group elements. These have been used to calculate the evolution of minor isotopes in TP-AGB stars of 1.5, 3 and 5 solar masses at metallicities of Z = 0.02, 0.008 and 0.004 evolved with mass loss. The results of these calculations are compared to known constraints from spectroscopic observations and measurements of pre-solar grains. At the end of the TP-AGB the star makes the transition to a white dwarf. In the course of trying to calculate this evolution it was found that numerical diffusion could substantially affect the evolution and that this phase has to be treated with great care.},

abstract = {There is increasing evidence that some massive globular clusters (GCs) host multiple stellar populations having different heavy element abundances enriched by supernovae. They usually accompany multiple red giant branches (RGBs) in the color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs), and are distinguished from most of the other GCs which display variations only in light element abundances. In order to investigate the star formation histories of these peculiar GCs, we have constructed synthetic CMDs for $\omega$ Cen, M22, and NGC 1851. Our models are based on the updated versions of Yonsei-Yale (Y2) isochrones and horizontal branch (HB) evolutionary tracks which include the cases of enhancements in both helium and the total CNO abundances. To estimate ages and helium abundances of subpopulations in each GC, we have compared our models with the observations on the Hess diagram by employing a $\chi$2 minimization technique. We find that metal-rich subpopulations in each of these GCs are also enhanced in helium abundance, and the age differences between the metal-rich and metal-poor subpopulations are fairly small ({\textasciitilde}0.3-1.7 Gyr), even in the models with the observed variations in the total CNO content. These are required to simultaneously reproduce the observed extended HB and the splits on the main sequence, subgiant branch, and RGB. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that these GCs are the relics of more massive primeval dwarf galaxies that merged and disrupted to form the proto-Galaxy.},

abstract = {Spectra have been obtained at the Ca II triplet of a number of member giants in seven galactic globular clusters for which current metallicity estimates are either lacking or poorly determined. Similar spectra have also been obtained of giants in eight clusters whose abundances are well established. These latter data have been combined with other existing CaII triplet observations to define a (Ca II triplet line strength, abundance) relation that encompasses the full range of metallicities exhibited by the Galaxy's globular cluster system. This calibration is then used to determine abundances for the program clusters. Specifically, we find [Fe/Il] -2.00+/-0.08, -0.67+/-0.07 -128+/-0.12, -0.36+/-0.09, -1.70+/-0.11, -1.55+/-0.10, and -1.99+/-0.08 for Pal 15, NGC 6366, NGC 6626 (M28), Terzan 7, Asp 2, NGC 6715 (M54), and Terzan 8, respectively. Further, although our sample in M54 is small (five stars), our results are consistent with the color-magnitude diagram based findings of Sarajedini {\&} Layden [AJ, 109,1086 (1995)], who have suggested that M54 may possess an internal abundance range characterized by $\sigma$([Fe/H]){\textasciitilde}0.15 dex. Radial velocities for the program clusters have also been derived from our spectra. With these new abundance and velocity data, and using other recent results from the literature, we have repeated the analysis of Zinn [ASP ConE. Ser. Vol. 48, p. 38 (1993)]. We confirm his finding of kinematic differences between two subsamples of the halo globular clusters. In particular, we find for the "younger halo" clusters, which have redder horizontal branch morphologies and/or younger ages at fixed abundance, a velocity dispersion $\sigma$_los_ = 163+/-25 km/s and a (retrograde) rotation of V_rot_ = -46+/-81 km/s. For the "old halo" clusters, which have bluer horizontal branch morphologies, the corresponding numbers are $\sigma$_los_= 106+/-11 km/s and V_rot_ 50+/-27 km/s. We note also that four of the clusters studied here (M54, Terzan 7, Arp 2, and Terzan 8) locations in the sky, radial velocities, and distances that associate them with the recently discovered Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy. We then compare the properties of this presumed Sagittarius cluster system with the cluster system of the Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy, noting in particular that for both systems the mean cluster abundance is considerably less than the mean abundance of the field star population. We note also that the Sagittarius cluster system, if integrated into the galactic halo, will contribute clusters to both the younger halo and old halo subsamples.},

abstract = {We present new spectroscopic observations for a sample of C(N)-type red giants. These objects belong to the class of asymptotic giant branch stars, experiencing thermal instabilities in the He-burning shell (thermal pulses). Mixing episodes called third dredge-up enrich the photosphere with newly synthesized 12C in the He-rich zone, and this is the source of the high observed ratio between carbon and oxygen (C/O>=1 by number). Our spectroscopic abundance estimates confirm that, in agreement with the general understanding of the late evolutionary stages of low- and intermediate-mass stars, carbon enrichment is accompanied by the appearance of s-process elements in the photosphere. We discuss the details of the observations and of the derived abundances, focusing in particular on rubidium, a neutron density sensitive element, and on the s-elements Sr, Y, and Zr belonging to the first s-peak. The critical reaction branching at 85Kr, which determines the relative enrichment of the studied species, is discussed. Subsequently, we compare our data with recent models for s-processing in thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch stars, at metallicities relevant for our sample. A remarkable agreement between model predictions and observations is found. Thanks to the different neutron density prevailing in low- and intermediate-mass stars, comparison with the models allows us to conclude that most C(N) stars are of low mass (M<{\textasciitilde}3 Msolar). We also analyze the 12C/13C ratios measured, showing that most of them cannot be explained by canonical stellar models. We discuss how this fact would require the operation of an ad hoc additional mixing, currently called cool bottom process, operating only in low-mass stars during the first ascent of the red giant branch and, perhaps, also during the asymptotic giant branch.},

abstract = {Observations of 11 giants in the globular cluster Ml 3 fainter than Mv=-1.7 have been obtained with the High Resolution Echelle Spectrograph on the Keck I Telescope. When combined with similar data for brighter giants obtained with the 3.0-m Shane Telescope's Hamilton Echelle spectrograph, these data allow examination of the detailed abundances of oxygen, sodium, magnesium, and aluminium over a wide range of luminosity on the red giant branch. We find that oxygen depletions, correlated with sodium enhancements, can be found in giants with luminosities down to nearly the level of the horizontal branch at Mv=0.3. Aluminum abundances in M13 giants also span a wide range ({\~{ }}1.4 dex) and are anticorrelated with the observed magnesium abundances. However, field halo giants of comparable metallicity and evolutionary state exhibit (normal) high abundances of 0 and Mg and low abundances of Na and Al. Stars in M13 with high sodium and aluminum and low oxygen and magnesium abundances are found at all giant branch luminosities, as are stars with more normal light element abundances (as defined by field halo stars of comparable metallicity). The detailed abundance patterns of the light elements oxygen, sodium, magnesium, and aluminum can be explained most easily as a result of deep mixing and proton capture nucleosynthesis. Evidence in support of this explanation is (a) the constancy of the abundances of Al+Mg and C+N+O, (b) the shift in the distribution of sodium abundances toward higher values and of oxygen abundances toward lower values in cluster giants with surface gravities below log g=1.0. The action of deep mixing, however, is seen not only at the top of the giant branch, but already in some giants even as faint as the level of the horizontal branch.},

abstract = {We present a series of simple, largely analytical models to compute the effects of disruption on the mass function of star clusters. Our calculations include evaporation by two-body relaxation and gravitational shocks and mass loss by stellar evolution. We find that, for a wide variety of initial conditions, the mass function develops a turnover or peak and that, after 12 Gyr, this is remarkably close to the observed peak for globular clusters, at Mp{\textasciitilde}2{\texttimes}105 Msolar. Below the peak, the evolution is dominated by two-body relaxation, and the mass function always develops a tail of the form $\psi$(M)=const, reflecting that the masses of tidally limited clusters decrease linearly with time just before they are destroyed. This also agrees well with the empirical mass function of globular clusters in the Milky Way. Above the peak, the evolution is dominated by stellar evolution at early times and by gravitational shocks at late times. These processes shift the mass function to lower masses, while nearly preserving its shape. The radial variation of the mass function within a galaxy depends on the initial position-velocity distribution of the clusters. We find that some radial anisotropy in the initial velocity distribution, especially when this increases outward, is needed to account for the observed near-uniformity of the mass functions of globular clusters. This may be consistent with the observed near-isotropy of the present velocity distributions, because clusters on elongated orbits are preferentially destroyed. These results are based on models with static, spherical galactic potentials. We point out that there would be even more radial mixing of the orbits and hence more uniformity of the mass function if the galactic potentials were time-dependent and/or nonspherical.},

abstract = {As part of a project to model the integrated spectra and colors of elliptical galaxies through evolutionary synthesis, we have refined our synthetic spectrum calculations of M giants. After critically assessing three effective temperature scales for M giants, we adopted the relation of Dyck et al. for our models. Using empirical spectra of field M giants as a guide, we then calculated MARCS stellar atmosphere models and SSG synthetic spectra of these cool stars, adjusting the band absorption oscillator strengths of the TiO bands to better reproduce the observational data. The resulting synthetic spectra are found to be in very good agreement with the K-band spectra of stars of the appropriate spectral type taken from Kleinmann {\&} Hall as well. Spectral types estimated from the strengths of the TiO bands and the depth of the band head of CO near 2.3 $\mu$m quantitatively confirm that the synthetic spectra are good representations of those of field M giants. The broadband colors of the models match the field relations of K and early-M giants very well; for late-M giants, differences between the field star and synthetic colors are probably caused by the omission of spectral lines of VO and H2O in the spectrum synthesis calculations. Here, we present four grids of K-band bolometric corrections and colors-Johnson U-V and B-V, Cousins V-R and V-I, Johnson-Glass V-K, J-K, and H-K, and CIT/CTIO V-K, J-K, H-K, and CO-for models having 3000 K<=Teff<=4000 K and -0.5<=logg<=1.5. These grids, which have [Fe/H]=+0.25, 0.0, -0.5, and -1.0, extend and supplement the color-temperature relations of hotter stars presented in a companion paper.},

abstract = {It is well known that thermally pulsing Asymptotic Giant Branch stars with low mass play a relevant role in the chemical evolution. They have synthesized about 30% of the galactic carbon and provide an important contribution to the nucleosynthesis of heavy elements (A > 80). The relevant nucleosynthesis site is the He-rich intermediate zone (less than 10-2 Msolar), where $\alpha$(2$\alpha$,$\gamma$)12C reactions and slow neutron captures on seed nuclei (essentially iron) take place. A key ingredient is the interplay between nuclear processes and convective mixing. It is the partial overlap of internal and external convective zones that allows the dredge-up of the material enriched in C and heavy elements. We review the progresses made in the last 50 years in the comprehension of the s process in AGB stars, with special attention to the identification of the main neutron sources and to the particular physical conditions allowing this important nucleosynthesis.},

We do this by combining four "realistic" stellar evolutionary sequences of different metallicities with a detailed nuclear reaction network. This approach allows for the variation in the temperature and density around the H shell as well as structural changes in the H shell caused by advancing evolution and variations in metallicity. In addition, our reaction network allows us to explore the effects of the uncertainties in the reaction rates on the abundance profiles. Our results are qualitatively consistent with the observed C vs. N, and O vs. N, Na, and Al anticorrelations as well as with the observed luminosity- and metallicity-dependent variations in the abundances and isotopic ratios. We find that the source of the large Al enhancements in some clusters is 24Mg, but contrary to the results of Shetrone (1996b;1997) we are unable to deplete the 24Mg abundance due to leakage from the NeNa cycle via the 23Na(p,gamma)24Mg reaction. We discuss possible remedies to this discrepancy.},
